        "question": "Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",
        "options": "A:Low unconjugated bilirubin:  Low unconjugated bilirubin is a condition in which the level of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood is lower than normal. Unconjugated bilirubin is a form of bilirubin that has not been processed by the liver. It is normally excreted in the bile, which is a fluid that helps digest fats. Low unconjugated bilirubin can be caused by a number of factors, including liver disease, gallbladder disease, and certain medications.\n B:Elevated lactate dehydrogenase:  Elevated lactate dehydrogenase is a condition in which the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the blood is higher than normal. LDH is an enzyme that is found in many tissues in the body, including the heart, liver, kidneys, and muscles. When cells are damaged, LDH is released into the blood. This can happen in a variety of conditions, including heart attack, liver disease, kidney disease, and muscle damage. Elevated LDH levels can also be a sign of certain types of cancer.\n C:Low ferritin:  Low ferritin is a condition in which the body has low levels of ferritin, a protein that stores iron. Ferritin is found in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. When iron levels are low, the body cannot produce enough red blood cells, which can lead to anemia.\n D:Low platelets:  Low platelets, also known as thrombocytopenia, is a condition in which the blood has a low count of platelets. Platelets are small, colorless blood cells that help stop bleeding by clumping together and forming a plug at the site of an injury.\n E:Elevated haptoglobin:  Elevated haptoglobin is a condition in which the level of haptoglobin in the blood is higher than normal. Haptoglobin is a protein that binds to hemoglobin, which is the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. When red blood cells are destroyed, haptoglobin binds to the hemoglobin and helps to clear it from the blood. Elevated haptoglobin levels can be a sign of a number of conditions, including:\n\n- Hemolytic anemia: A condition in which red blood cells are destroyed prematurely\n- Liver disease: The liver produces haptoglobin, so liver damage can lead to elevated haptoglobin levels\n- Inflammation",

The patient is sent to the cardiac catheter laboratory where she undergoes percutaneous catheterization. She has 2 occluded vessels in the heart and undergoes a percutaneous coronary intervention to place 2 stents in her coronary arteries. Blood flow is successfully restored in the affected arteries. The patient complains of flank pain on post-procedure evaluation a few hours later. A significant drop in hematocrit is observed, as well as a drop in her blood pressure to 90/60 mm Hg.

This can lead to bleeding, infection, or damage to the artery.\n B:Fat embolism:  Fat embolism is a condition in which fat droplets enter the bloodstream and block small blood vessels, usually in the lungs. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain, and confusion. Fat embolism can be a serious condition, and can even be fatal.\n C:Patent ductus arteriosus:  A congenital heart defect in which the ductus arteriosus, a blood vessel that connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery in a fetus, fails to close after birth.\n D:Adrenal hemorrhage:  Adrenal hemorrhage is a condition in which there is bleeding within the adrenal gland. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, infection, or certain medical conditions. Adrenal hemorrhage can lead to a number of symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weakness.
