      "\n",
      "Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical and thriller film written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory, and his fall from grace after his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The ensemble supporting cast includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek and Kenneth Branagh.\n",
      "Oppenheimer was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures since Memento (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and HBO Max release schedule. Murphy was the first cast member to sign on the following month, with the rest joining between November 2021 and April 2022. Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film, including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX black-and-white film photography. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal compositing.\n",
      "Oppenheimer premiered at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the US and the UK ten days later by Universal. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s Barbie was the catalyst of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a double feature. Oppenheimer grossed over $974 million worldwide, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 2023, the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the second-highest-grossing R-rated film.\n",
      "Among its many accolades, Oppenheimer won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Murphy and Best Supporting Actor for Downey. It also won five Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture – Drama) and seven British Academy Film Awards (including Best Film), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the National Board of Review and the American Film Institute.\n",
      "\n",

      "== Plot ==\n",
      "In 1926, the 22-year-old doctoral student J. Robert Oppenheimer grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental quantum physics under Patrick Blackett at the University of Cambridge. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett and leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist Niels Bohr advises Oppenheimer to study theoretical physics at the University of Göttingen.\n",
      "Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi. They later meet theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg in Switzerland. Wanting to expand quantum physics research in the US, Oppenheimer teaches at the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology. He marries Katherine \"Kitty\" Puening, a biologist and ex-communist, and has an intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock, a troubled communist psychiatrist who later dies by suicide.\n",
      "When nuclear fission is discovered in 1938 after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it could be weaponized. In 1942, during World War II, US Army Colonel Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory to develop an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer fears the German nuclear research program, led by Heisenberg, might yield a fission bomb for the Nazis.\n",
      "Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller, and collaborates with the scientists Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard, and David L. Hill at the University of Chicago. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could destroy the world. After consulting with Albert Einstein, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are acceptably low. Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a hydrogen bomb is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.\n",
      "After Germany's surrender in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the ongoing Pacific War and save Allied lives. The Trinity test is successful, and President Harry S. Truman orders the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in Japan's surrender. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his guilt to Truman, the president berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development.\n",
      "As an advisor to the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning Cold War. AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting radioisotopes and for recommending negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviets successfully detonated their own bomb. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.\n",
      "In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates a private security hearing before a Personnel Security Board concerning Oppenheimer's Q clearance during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a show trial. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are exploited, and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty delivers impassioned testimony in defense of herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but revokes his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.\n",
      "In 1959, during Strauss's Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce, Hill testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is voted down. In 1963, President Lyndon B. Johnson presents Oppenheimer with the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation.\n",
      "A flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation never mentioned Strauss. Instead, the two discussed Oppenheimer’s legacy, and Oppenheimer expressed his fear that they had indeed started a chain reaction that will destroy the world.\n",

      "The director Sam Mendes was interested in adapting the 2005 Oppenheimer biography American Prometheus (2005) by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. After that project failed to materialize, the book was optioned by various filmmakers over the next fifteen years. The authors became pessimistic about a film adaptation. Oliver Stone declined an opportunity to direct, saying he \"couldn't find my way to its essence\". In 2015, J. David Wargo optioned the book, then commissioned and rejected several scripts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wargo flew to Hollywood to meet with actor James Woods, who set up a meeting with Charles Roven, a producer for various Christopher Nolan films, and in turn, Roven gave a copy of the book to Nolan. Both Wargo and Woods are executive producers of the film.\n",
      "Nolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading American Prometheus. In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave him a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed Oppenheimer \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\", in contrast to Tenet, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction.\n",
      "In December 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures announced plans to give its 2021 films simultaneous releases in theaters and on HBO Max, citing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. Nolan, who had partnered with Warner Bros. on each of his films since Insomnia (2002), was outraged, as he was a staunch supporter of traditional film exhibition. In January 2021, media reports mentioned the possibility that Nolan's next film could be the first not to be financed or distributed by Warner Bros. By mid-2021, Nolan had left Warner Bros. and was meeting with other studios to develop his new project. Nolan had previously supported Warner's decision to give Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) a simultaneous release, saying he felt that situation had been handled properly, but said he had been excluded from any discussions regarding the postponed release of Tenet.\n",
      "In September 2021, it was announced that Nolan would write and direct a biographical film about Oppenheimer and his contributions to the Manhattan Project, with Cillian Murphy in negotiations to star. Due to his strained relationship with Warner Bros., Nolan approached multiple studios, including Sony, Universal, Paramount, and Apple. According to insiders, Paramount was ruled out early in the process due to the replacement of the CEO and chairman, Jim Gianopulos, with Brian Robbins, an advocate for increased streaming-service releases.\n",
      "Nolan signed with Universal because he had previously worked with Donna Langley, chairwoman and chief content officer of the NBCUniversal studio group, on an unsuccessful attempt to make a film version of the UK television series The Prisoner. Langley agreed with Nolan's stance on traditional film exhibition and Universal agreed to finance and distribute Oppenheimer, with production set to begin in the first quarter of 2022. Universal also agreed to Nolan's terms, which included a production budget of $100 million, an equal marketing budget, an exclusive theatrical window ranging from 90 to 120 days, 20 percent of the film's first-dollar gross, and a three-week period both before and after the opening, in which Universal could not release another new film.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Writing ===\n",
      "Nolan became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric \"How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\" in the Sting song \"Russians\" (1985). He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety. Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life. Emily Blunt described the Oppenheimer script as \"emotional\" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had \"Trojan-Horsed a biopic into a thriller\".\n",
      "By September 2021, both Roven and Nolan had begun contacting Bird and Sherwin to discuss the script. During Bird's first meeting with Nolan, he had already written a spec script while they discussed the script's content, although Nolan did not disclose the script to them yet. Oppenheimer is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer's perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale. He began developing the script after he completed Tenet and wrote it in only a few months; he had already been thinking about making a film about Oppenheimer for over 20 years.\n",
      "A major plot element is Oppenheimer's response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\". He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively, with most of Oppenheimer's view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character's point of view\". Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer's conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy. Nolan noted that while Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he still believed Oppenheimer had felt genuine guilt for his actions and thus portrayed him as exhibiting those feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nolan began by trying to find the \"thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey\" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life. As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with Jean Tatlock. He also wanted to explore Tatlock's influence on Oppenheimer's life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer's] later life and his ultimate fate\". Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in Amadeus (1984).\n",
      "Another critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President Harry S. Truman called Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a \"massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with\", while also underscoring that it is a \"huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception\". He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\". For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to present a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Casting ===\n",
      "Oppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy read extensively on Oppenheimer's life and was inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s. Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted and was excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room. Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance. Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014). As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts.\n",
      "The casting process was so secretive that some cast members did not know which role they would be playing until they signed on. Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt took pay cuts to work on the film, with each earning $4 million in lieu of their usual $10–20 million upfront salary. Downey went to Nolan's house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper. Downey would later describe Oppenheimer as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date. Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like. Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon—who had appeared in Nolan's Interstellar—was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to Oppenheimer as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film. Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in Licorice Pizza (2021). Safdie had worked alongside a nuclear physicist at Columbia University while in high school. It is Nolan's first film since Insomnia (2002) to not feature Michael Caine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Filming ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Pre-production had begun by January 2022 in New Mexico, where a two-day casting call took place in Santa Fe and Los Alamos for people to audition to play local residents, military personnel, and scientists. Another casting call was held in February.\n",
      "Principal photography began on February 28, 2022, at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico, and lasted for 57 days with Hoyte van Hoytema serving as cinematographer. The original shooting schedule had set aside approximately 85 days for filming. However, during pre-production, it had become clear that principal photography could not be completed within $100 million over that many days on location all over the United States. To efficiently use the budget for location shooting in California and New Jersey and constructing high-quality historically accurate sets in New Mexico, Nolan compressed the shooting schedule from 85 to 57 days. Murphy, who appears in nearly every scene, described the pace as \"insane\".\n",
      "Gary Oldman said he would be on set for a day in May for \"one scene, a page and a half\". \n",
      "The original choice for Oval Office location in the Nixon Presidential Library fell through a week before filming, and since Oldman's dates were unmovable, the production design team redressed the Oval Office set from Veep, which according to Ruth De Jong had fallen into \"nightmarish\" disrepair.\n",
      "Nolan filmed his eldest child, his daughter Flora, in a scene in which she played a young woman disintegrated in a nuclear explosion. It appears in the film as one of Oppenheimer's visions, in which Nolan intended to show \"that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you\".\n",
      "The film used a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film. It is also the first film to shoot sections on IMAX black-and-white photographic film, which Kodak created and FotoKem developed specifically for the film. Van Hoytema used 50 mm and 80 mm Hasselblad lenses when filming on the IMAX MKIV or IMAX MSM 9802 cameras, while scenes shot on the Panavision Panaflex System 65 Studio cameras were shot using Panavision Sphero 65 and Panavision System 65 lenses. Additionally, the production had Panavision construct a custom probe lens to allow the filmmakers to use IMAX cameras for macro photography and microphotography to record the miniature effects. In the second week of April, filming took place on location at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Filming also occurred in California, primarily around the campus of the University of California, Berkeley. Scenes set in the city of Berkeley itself were filmed in Pasadena.\n",
      "During a 2021 research trip, Nolan discovered that Los Alamos had drastically changed from its 1940s appearance and could not be used for exterior shots of the town; for example, the town's equivalent of a Main Street has a Starbucks. Instead, the production team constructed a version of 1940s-era Los Alamos on top of a similar plateau at Ghost Ranch. It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days. The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos. Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022. Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos. Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance. The New York hotel scenes were shot in Albuquerque's Old Post Office building, while the Washington, D.C. scenes were shot in state government buildings in the state capital of Santa Fe.\n",
      "Filming involved the use of real explosives to recreate the Trinity nuclear test, forgoing the use of computer-generated graphics. When this news first broke online, many fans (aware of Nolan's famous preference for in-camera practical effects) thought it meant he had set off a real atomic bomb. Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert. The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather. A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect. Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the special effects supervisor, Scott R. Fisher, referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective. Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods. Nolan claimed the film contains no computer-generated effects, and used practical effects to achieve \"real-world imagery\". Filming wrapped in May 2022.\n",

      "=== Post-production ===\n",
      "Editing was completed by Jennifer Lame, who had previously edited Tenet. While inspecting the footage during editing, Nolan and Lame performed \"character passes\" to ensure all the characters were properly displayed on screen, due to the film having a faster pace than most traditional blockbusters. Visual effects were handled by DNEG, which produced more than 100 VFX shots from more than 400 practically shot elements, marking their eighth collaboration with Nolan. Andrew Jackson was the visual effects supervisor, who stated that the film used mostly \"invisible\" visual effects through \"'in-camera' special effects created on set\". Digital compositing was used for the Trinity scene to add multi-layers to the explosion which was shot in a multifaceted viewpoint.\n",
      "Steven Spielberg was the first person to see the final cut, in a private screening of its first 70mm print. Nolan said: \"He said some very kind things, but really just to watch him watch ... I wasn't even supposed to watch it with him, but seeing the great master watching? It was sort of irresistible.\"\n",

It was also featured in the Universal Pictures exclusive five-minute Opening Look on July 13. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from \"the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds\".\n",

Empire commented that it is exemplary of Nolan's style: \"heady, brooding stuff with a real sense of weight\". In December 2022, two trailers premiered in front of Avatar: The Way of Water, with one being exclusive to IMAX theaters and the other being shown in all other formats. The latter was eventually released online. In May 2023, an official main trailer debuted during preview screenings of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. It was subsequently released to the public on May 8, 2023, alongside a theatrical release poster.\n",

      "Oppenheimer had its world premiere at Le Grand Rex in Paris on July 11, 2023, followed by the British premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square in London on July 13, and the American premiere at AMC Lincoln Square 13 in New York City on July 17. Both the London and the New York premieres were affected by the SAG-AFTRA strike, as some actors left the London premiere early, and Universal Pictures canceled the red carpet event for the New York premiere. SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher later claimed the studios \"duped\" the guild into accepting a twelve-day-extension for negotiations to continue promoting summer films like Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was released theatrically on July 21, 2023, by Universal Pictures. In addition to standard digital cinemas, it was also released in various film formats including IMAX 70 mm (30 prints), standard 70 mm (113 prints) and 35 mm (around 80 prints).\n",
      "The film was released on the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was made in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal. Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\", and was described as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\". Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"\n",
      "In March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Oppenheimer had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of \"preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values\".\n",
      "The film was not released in Japan until eight months after its initial global release. Variety noted the controversial reputation in Japan due to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A Universal spokesperson said that \"plans have not been finalized in all markets\". American films are often released in Japan a few months after the initial theatrical release. In December 2023, the independent Japanese film distributor Bitters End announced that it would theatrically release the film in 2024, as Universal's distributor in Japan Toho-Towa opted not to release it. The film was later released by Bitters End in Japan on March 29, and during its first three days, it was ranked as the country's highest grossing foreign film after making 379.3 million yen ($2.5 million) at the box office.\n",

      "==== Classifications and censorship ====\n",
      "In the United States, the film received an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association for \"some sexuality, nudity, and language\". It is Nolan's first film to receive that rating since Insomnia (2002). In Australia, the film received an MA 15+ rating from the Australian Classification Board board for \"strong sex and a suicide scene\". In the United Kingdom, the film received a 15 certificate from the British Board of Film Classification for \"strong language and sex\", meaning anyone under the age of 15 cannot be admitted to view the film. In some countries, including those in the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia, Universal distributed a version of the film with Florence Pugh's nude body covered by a computer-generated black dress.\n",
      "In India, Oppenheimer was released with all scenes depicting nudity, sex and cigarette smoking being censored, earning the U/A certificate from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) while retaining the running time. The audio of the scene in which Tatlock directs Oppenheimer to read a verse from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita, \"I am become Death, destroyer of worlds\", remained intact. As NDTV reported, the Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur questioned how the CBFC certified the film with the verse heard during such circumstance in the first place, and asked the scene to be deleted. Hindu nationalists were angered by the scene and demanded its removal. Among them was journalist Uday Mahurkar, who wrote an open letter to Nolan calling the scene a \"direct assault on religious beliefs of a billion tolerant Hindus\", and demanded its removal from all releases of Oppenheimer across the world. On the other hand, actor Nitish Bharadwaj told The Times of India that \"The use of this verse in the film should also be understood from Oppenheimer's emotional state of mind. A scientist thinks of his creation 24x7x365 days, irrespective of what he is doing. His mind space is consumed fully of his creation & the physical act is just a natural mechanical act.\"\n",

      "=== Home media ===\n",
      "Oppenheimer was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray, regular Blu-ray and DVD formats including digital on November 21, 2023. As the former two releases sold out days after release, Universal worked on restocking before the holiday season. Nolan was vocal during the home release campaign of the film about the importance of physical media libraries, stating that letting films only exist digitally or on streaming services allows companies to have too much control and creates a danger for film preservation. The film was released for streaming in the US exclusively on Peacock and in Canada on Amazon Prime Video on February 16, 2024.\n",
      "Additionally, it began streaming on Jio Cinema in India from March 21, 2024.\n",

      "As of April 27, 2024, Oppenheimer has grossed $329.9 million in the United States and Canada and $644.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $974.3 million. It is the second-highest-grossing R-rated film of all-time behind Joker (2019). In September 2023, Oppenheimer became the highest-grossing biographical film of all time, surpassing Bohemian Rhapsody (2018).\n",
      "By August 2023, Oppenheimer had become the highest-grossing film ever to not reach the top spot at the domestic box office, although in its sixth weekend it topped the worldwide box office with a total of $38.12 million, surpassing Barbie for the first time. It is also the highest grossing World War II-related film, surpassing Dunkirk (2017), also a Nolan film. Additionally, Oppenheimer became one of the top five highest-grossing IMAX releases, earning $183 million (approximately 20% of its total gross), over $17 million of which was earned from the 30 screens showing IMAX 70 mm prints. The film was booked to be rereleased in IMAX theaters on November 3, including six IMAX 70 mm prints, as these theaters reported selling out during the initial release. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $201.9 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.\n",

      "==== United States and Canada ====\n",
      "In the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer was released alongside Barbie, in what became known as 'Barbenheimer'. The week of their releases, AMC Theatres announced that over 40,000 AMC Stubs members had already pre-booked tickets to both films on the same day. After grossing $33 million on its first day (including $10.5 million from Thursday night previews), it went on to debut to $82.5 million, finishing second behind Barbie and marking one of the best opening weekends ever for an R-rated drama. 64% of the audience was male, with 33% being 18–34 years old. The Barbenheimer phenomenon was credited with boosting interest in the film, with a total of 79% of tickets sold over the weekend being for the two films (27% for Oppenheimer), a combined total of 18.5 million people. The opening weekend was Nolan's best for an original film, being the highest of his filmography outside of the latter two films from The Dark Knight trilogy. It achieved the third-highest opening weekend for a biopic film, behind The Passion of the Christ (2004) and American Sniper (2014).\n",
      "Oppenheimer made $46.2 million in its second weekend (a drop of 44%), remaining in second behind Barbie. The film made $28.7 million in its third weekend, finishing third behind Barbie and newcomer Meg 2: The Trench. On August 16, Oppenheimer surpassed Sing (2016) to become the highest-grossing film to never reach the number one spot at the box office. During its fourth weekend, the film made $18.8 million (a drop of 35%) rising back up to second place. In its fifth and sixth weekends, the film grossed $10.7 million and $9 million (a drop of 43% and 16% respectively), finishing in third and fourth place at the box office and passing $300 million domestically in its sixth weekend. Following its 13 Oscar nominations, the film expanded from 1,008 theaters to 2,262 in its 28th week of release and made $1 million, an increase of 284% from the previous weekend.\n",

      "==== Other territories ====\n",
      "Outside the United States and Canada, Oppenheimer grossed $98 million in its opening weekend. The following weekend, it earned $77.1 million, dropping by 21% to become Nolan's highest-grossing film in 30 countries, including India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Turkey. In its third weekend, Oppenheimer grossed $52.8 million (a drop of 31%) and $32 million in its fourth weekend. It held well in the following weeks, making $32 million and $29.1 million in its fifth and sixth weekends. As of September 10, 2023, the highest-grossing territories were the UK ($75 million), China ($61.6 million), Germany ($51.9 million), France ($43.1 million) and Australia ($25.9 million).    \n",
      "In Japan, Oppenheimer was released on March 29, 2024. It attracted controversy in Japan, and Warner Bros. issued an apology following criticism of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon as insensitive, Nevertheless, the film would manage to gross $2.5 million and place third in the country's box office during its opening weekend in Japan.\n",

      "=== Critical response ===\n",
      "The film received critical acclaim. Critics praised Oppenheimer primarily for its screenplay, cast performances, and visuals. It was frequently ranked as one of Nolan's best films, and one of the best of 2023. Hindustan Times reported that the film was hailed as one of the best of the 21st century. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 505 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Oppenheimer marks another engrossing achievement from Christopher Nolan that benefits from Murphy's tour-de-force performance and stunning visuals.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 69 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those polled by PostTrak gave it a 93% overall positive score, with 74% saying they would definitely recommend the film.\n",
      "Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four, describing it as \"magnificent\" and \"one of the best films of the 21st century\". The A.V. Club's Matthew Jackson deemed it a \"masterpiece\", adding that \"it's Christopher Nolan's best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers and a movie that burns itself into your brain\". Empire's Dan Jolin labeled it a \"masterfully constructed character study\", taking particular note of Murphy's performance and van Hoytema's IMAX cinematography. Peter Suderman writing for Reason said that the film leaves the viewer with a sense of \"fear and foreboding about the horror of full-on nuclear conflict in the wake of the nuclear bomb. Humanity is both great and terrible. Oppenheimer isn't just a movie—it's a warning.\"\n",
      "Matt Zoller Seitz, writing for RogerEbert.com awarded Oppenheimer a full four out of four rating. He lauded Nolan's storytelling, exploration of Oppenheimer's character and its technical achievements, concluding: \"As a physical experience, Oppenheimer is something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what and that's what's so fascinating about it\". Peter Travers described the film as a \"monumental achievement\" and \"one of the best films you'll see anywhere\". Caryn James of BBC Culture similarly termed it \"boldly imaginative and [Nolan's] most mature work yet\", adding that it combined the \"explosive, commercially-enticing action of The Dark Knight trilogy\" with the \"cerebral underpinnings\" of Memento, Inception and Tenet. IGN critic Siddhant Adlakha ranked Oppenheimer 10/10, describing it as \"a three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller\" and Nolan's most \"abstract\" work yet.\n",
      "Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV rated the film four and a half out of five and stated: \"Oppenheimer, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavor and ambition\". In August 2023, it ranked number three on Collider's list of \"The 20 Best Drama Movies of the 2020s So Far,\" writing that Nolan \"explores the world's obsession with destructive nuclear weapons from the perspective of their creator; using the Greek myth of Dante  [sic] as an inspiration, Oppenheimer makes it clear that once this type of power is unleashed, it is bound to be used again.\"\n",
      "Despite praising the film's themes and performances, CNN's Brian Lowry believed that \"Nolan juggles a lot, in a way that somewhat works to the movie's detriment\". While praising how the film acknowledges the contribution of \"American scientists and American enterprise\", Brett Mason complained that it omits the crucial contributions of non-Americans who ensured the work was able to commence as early as December 1941: \"Nolan completely ignores the crucial role that British science and Australian physicist Mark Oliphant played in jump-starting the quest.\" Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang defended Nolan's accurate depiction of how Oppenheimer could not see the true victims of his work. Chang wrote that instead of satisfying \"representational completists\" by detouring to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \"Nolan treats them instead as a profound absence, an indictment by silence\". According to Richard Brody, the movie-listings editor at The New Yorker who described the film as a \"History Channel movie with fancy editing\", \"I was tempted to call it a movie-length Wikipedia article. But after a look online, I realized I was giving Wikipedia too little credit—or Christopher Nolan, the movie's writer and director, too much\".\n",
      "For IndieWire's annual critics poll, in which 158 critics and journalists from around the world voted, Oppenheimer was placed second in their Best Film list, with 69 overall mentions and 17 first-place votes. Nolan was also ranked second on the Best Director list, while his screenplay was placed eighth. Murphy was the highest-placed actor on the Best Performance list (fourth overall) while Van Hoytema's work topped the Best Cinematography list. Oppenheimer also appeared in over 410 critics' lists of the best films released in 2023, and was ranked first in 99 of them.\n",

      "==== Response by filmmakers ====\n",
      "Oliver Stone deemed the film \"a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate\". Paul Schrader called Oppenheimer, \"the best, most important film of this century\", while Denis Villeneuve called it \"a masterpiece\". Steven Soderbergh said of the film, \"Oppenheimer is a real accomplishment. I read somewhere that Chris [Nolan] implied that this is the movie he's been building toward, and I think he's right. And I'm thrilled that it's a massive hit.\" Spike Lee also praised the film, calling it a 'great film', but felt that it should have showed what happened to the Japanese people, given the film's length. Japanese director Takashi Yamazaki said, “As a person of Japanese ancestry and descent, my response to Oppenheimer [is that] I would like to dedicate a different film to that when that day comes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Accuracy and omissions ====\n",
      "\n",
      "The film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events. Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film since he did not know how significant it would become. The study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time and not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\" but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer.\n",
      "It was also pointed out that the incorrect American flag was used. In the film, the current 50-star flag is shown. This version was not adopted until 1960. During the  war, the American flag had only 48 stars as Hawaii and Alaska had yet to become states.\n",
      "The scene where Oppenheimer poisons his professor's apple is based on accounts that Oppenheimer gave of the incident, but it is unclear whether it occurred in real life. Oppenheimer is depicted as putting potassium cyanide in the apple before having a change of heart the next day and narrowly preventing it from being eaten. There is no evidence that Niels Bohr nearly ate the apple or had any involvement in the incident. Oppenheimer and Einstein were friends, but the specific conversations which the film revolves around never happened. Oppenheimer took his concerns about an unstoppable chain reaction to physicist Karl Compton at MIT, not Einstein. Whereas, Arthur Compton at the Metallurgical Laboratory was the first to appoint Oppenheimer to take over the research into the bomb-design part of the Manhattan Project.\n",
      "In addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the hydrogen bomb by the United States. Scott Sagan describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence as a possible constraint upon the nuclear arms race between the US and USSR as a \"broader tragedy\" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy but he called the production \"highly accurate\" otherwise for a Hollywood film.\n",
      "Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites like Hanford, Washington and Oak Ridge, Tennessee were not shown. Most of them, overseen by General Leslie Groves, focused on producing the radioactive material that powered the nuclear explosions. In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory, also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.\n",
      "Another technical problem accurately represented throughout the film was plutonium production. This can be analyzed through the occurrence of discussions of fizzle, ingenuity, engineering breakthroughs and setbacks, and once again, the determination to succeed. The film focused on the great cost it took to obtain the plutonium, as well as the overall process of breeding plutonium. Enrico Fermi, a main scientist involved in the Manhattan Project, was the one who discovered that plutonium was the element necessary to produce a spontaneous fission reaction. His contributions to the Manhattan Project were not included in the film as much as they were recognized in real-life.\n",
      "In the film, a scene depicts the May 31, 1945, meeting of the Interim Committee, which J. Robert Oppenheimer attended as a member of the Scientific Panel of consultants. In this scene, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson is portrayed ordering the removal of Kyoto from the list of top atomic bomb targets, allegedly because it was a favored honeymoon destination for him and his wife. However, historian of science and nuclear weapons, Alex Wellerstein, clarifies that this portrayal is a myth. According to Wellerstein, Stimson's diary from his 1926 travels with his wife does not mention Kyoto, and the only brief visit they made there was in 1929, during a single night stay while on a \"fact-finding\" mission related to his role as Governor-General of the Philippines. The film's depiction overlooks that Stimson's objection to targeting Kyoto was primarily strategic rather than personal. He expressed this viewpoint to President Truman on multiple occasions, including at the Potsdam Conference. Stimson wrote in his diary on July 24, 1945, \"He [Truman] again reiterated with the utmost emphasis his own concurring belief on that subject, and he was particularly emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion that if elimination was not done, the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long post-war period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to the Russians.\"  \n",
      "An omission that drew some criticism was the lack of discussion of the impact of nuclear testing on the Indigenous population around the Trinity test site. Kate Gardner in a review of the film for physicsworld writes, \n",
      "\n",
      "The one glaring omission from the film is in fact 19,000 omissions – the number of people, mostly Indigenous, who lived near the Trinity test site in New Mexico. Oppenheimer implies the area was empty, side-stepping the thorny truth that local residents were not warned about the test at all – not even given a false story to prevent them from drinking the toxic rainwater that fell for the next few days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Influence ===\n",
      "The renewed attention to the site and associated nuclear testing encouraged the United States Congress to revise the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (1990), which provided compensation programs for people affected by radiation and nuclear testing during the Cold War, known as \"Downwinders\" and primarily consisting of the Navajo Nation. The United States Senate approved amendments to accommodate additional services to people in New Mexico, but it has not passed through Congress as the House of Representatives had not yet debated its inclusion as part of the national defense bill for the 2024 fiscal year.\n",

      "Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is a technique in personalised medicine and nuclear medicine where a one radioactive drug is used to identify (diagnose) and a second radioactive drug is used to treat cancerous tumors. \n",
      "In other words, theranostics combines radionuclide imaging and radiation therapy which targets specific biological pathways. Technologies used for theranostic imaging include radiotracers, contrast agents and positron emission tomography. It has been used to treat thyroid cancer and neuroblastomas.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Nuclear medicine ===\n",
      "Theranostics originated in the field of nuclear medicine; iodine isotope 131 for the diagnostic study and treatment of thyroid cancer was one of its earliest applications. Nuclear medicine encompasses various substances, either alone or in combination, that can be used for diagnostic imaging and targeted therapy. These substances may include ligands of receptors present on the target tissue or compounds, like iodine, that are internalized by the target through metabolic processes. By using these mechanisms, theranostics enables the localization of pathological tissues with imaging and the targeted destruction of these tissues using high doses of radiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Radiological scope ===\n",
      "Contrast agents with therapeutic properties have been under development for several years. One example is the design of contrast agents capable of releasing a chemotherapeutic agent locally at the target site, triggered by a stimulus provided by the operator. This localized approach aims to increase treatment efficacy and minimize side effects. For instance, ultrasound-based contrast media, such as microbubbles, can accumulate in hypervascularized tissues and release the active ingredient in response to ultrasound waves, thus targeting a specific area chosen by the sonographer. Another approach involves linking monoclonal antibodies (capable of targeting different molecular targets) to nanoparticles. This strategy enhances the drug's affinity and specificity towards the target and enables visualization of the treatment area, such as using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles detectable by magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, these particles can be designed to release chemotherapy agents specifically at the site of binding, producing a local synergistic effect with antibody action. Integrating these methods with medical-nuclear techniques, which offer greater imaging sensitivity, may aid in target identification and treatment monitoring.\n",

      "\n",
      "== Imaging techniques ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Positron emission tomography ===\n",
      "Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in theranostics provides insight into metabolic and molecular processes within the body. The PET scanner detects  photons and creates three-dimensional images that enable visualization and quantification of physiological and biochemical processes. PET imaging uses radiotracers that target specific molecules or processes. For example, [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is commonly used to assess glucose metabolism, as cancer cells exhibit increased glucose uptake. Other radiotracers target specific receptors, enzymes, or transporters, allowing the evaluation of various physiological and pathological processes.\n",
      "PET imaging plays a role in both diagnosis and treatment planning. It aids in the identification and staging of diseases, such as cancer, by visualizing the extent and metabolic activity of tumors. PET scans can also guide treatment decisions by assessing treatment response and monitoring disease progression. Additionally, PET imaging is used to determine the suitability of patients for targeted therapies based on specific molecular characteristics, enabling personalized treatment approaches. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Single-photon emission computed tomography ===\n",
      " \n",
      "Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is employed in theranostics, using gamma rays emitted by a radiotracer to generate three-dimensional images of the body. SPECT imaging involves the injection of a radiotracer that emits single photons, which are detected by a gamma camera rotating around the person undergoing imaging.\n",
      "SPECT provides functional and anatomical information, allowing the assessment of organ structure, blood flow, and specific molecular targets. It is useful in evaluating diseases that involve altered blood flow or specific receptor expression. For example, SPECT imaging with technetium-99m (Tc-99m) radiopharmaceuticals may be able to assess myocardial perfusion and identify areas of ischemia or infarction in patients with cardiovascular diseases.\n",
      "SPECT imaging helps in identifying disease localization, staging, and assessing the response to therapy. Moreover, SPECT imaging is employed in targeted radionuclide therapy, where the same radiotracer used for diagnostic imaging can be used to deliver therapeutic doses of radiation to the diseased tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Magnetic resonance imaging ===\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses strong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to generate detailed anatomical and functional images of the body. MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and is widely used in theranostics for its ability to visualize anatomical structures and assess physiological processes.\n",
      "In theranostics, MRI allows for the detection and characterization of tumors, assessment of tumor extent, and evaluation of treatment response. MRI can provide information on tissue perfusion, diffusion, and metabolism, aiding in the selection of appropriate therapies and monitoring their effectiveness.\n",
      "Advancements in MRI technology have expanded its capabilities in theranostics. Techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) enable the assessment of brain activation and connectivity, while diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides insights into tissue microstructure. The development of molecular imaging agents, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, allows for targeted imaging and tracking of specific molecular entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Therapeutic approaches ==\n",
      "Theranostics encompasses a range of therapeutic approaches that are designed to target and treat diseases with enhanced precision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Targeted drug delivery systems ===\n",
      "Targeted drug delivery systems facilitate the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to specific disease sites while minimizing off-target effects. These systems employ strategies, such as nanoparticles, liposomes, and micelles, to encapsulate drugs and enhance their stability, solubility, and bioavailability. By incorporating diagnostic components, such as imaging agents or targeting ligands, into these delivery systems, clinicians can monitor drug distribution and accumulation in real-time, ensuring effective treatment and reducing systemic toxicity. Targeted drug delivery systems hold promise in the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and other conditions, as they allow for personalized and site-specific therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Gene therapy ===\n",
      "Gene therapy is a therapeutic approach that involves modifying or replacing faulty genes to treat or prevent diseases. In theranostics, gene therapy can be combined with diagnostic imaging to monitor the delivery, expression, and activity of therapeutic genes. Imaging techniques such as MRI, PET, and optical imaging enable non-invasive assessment of gene transfer and expression, providing valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of gene-based treatments. Gene therapy has shown potential in treating genetic disorders, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases, and its integration with diagnostic imaging offers a comprehensive approach for monitoring and optimizing treatment outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Radiotherapy ===\n",
      "Radiotherapy can be integrated with imaging techniques to guide treatment planning, monitor radiation dose distribution, and assess treatment response. Molecular imaging methods, such as PET and SPECT, can be employed to visualize and quantify tumor characteristics, such as hypoxia or receptor expression, aiding in personalized radiation dose optimization10. Additionally, theranostic approaches involving radiolabeled therapeutic agents, known as radiotheranostics, combine the therapeutic effects of radiation with diagnostic capabilities. Radiotheranostics, including Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), hold promise for targeted radiotherapy, enabling precise tumor targeting and dose escalation while sparing healthy tissues. For example, peptide-radio-receptor-therapy (PRRT) based on 177Lutetium combinations (known as radioligands) has emerged as a treatment option for inoperable metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Immunotherapy ===\n",
      " Immunotherapy harnesses the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells or other disease targets. In theranostics, immunotherapeutic approaches can be coupled with diagnostic imaging to assess immune cell infiltration, tumor immunogenicity, and treatment response. Imaging techniques, such as PET and MRI, can provide valuable information about the tumor microenvironment, immune cell dynamics, and response to immunotherapies. Furthermore, theranostic strategies involving the use of radiolabeled immunotherapeutic agents allow for simultaneous imaging and therapy, aiding in patient selection, treatment monitoring, and optimization of immunotherapeutic regimens.\n",

      "=== Nanomedicine ===\n",
      "Nanomedicine refers to the use of nanoscale materials for medical applications. In theranostics, nanomedicine offers opportunities for targeted drug delivery, imaging, and therapy. Nanoparticles can be engineered to carry therapeutic payloads, imaging agents, and targeting ligands, allowing for multimodal theranostic approaches. These nanocarriers can enhance drug stability, improve drug solubility, and enable controlled release at the disease site. Additionally, nanomaterials with inherent imaging properties, such as quantum dots or gold nanoparticles, can serve as contrast agents for imaging.\n",

      "== Applications and challenges ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Oncology ===\n",
      "Theranostics has been applied in oncology, contributing to new approaches in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cancers. By integrating diagnostic imaging and targeted therapies, theranostics offers personalized approaches that improve treatment outcomes and patient care. In oncology, theranostics encompasses a wide range of applications, including the management of various types of cancers such as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Molecular imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), enable the visualization and characterization of cancerous lesions, aiding in early detection, staging, and assessment of treatment response. This allows for more accurate and tailored treatment planning, including the selection of appropriate targeted therapies or the optimization of radiation therapy. Despite the significant progress, the translation of theranostics into routine clinical practice faces challenges, including the need for standardized imaging protocols, biomarker validation, and regulatory considerations. Additionally, there is a continuous need for research and development to further enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of theranostic approaches in oncology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Neurology and cardiology ===\n",
      "Theranostics extends beyond oncology and holds potential in the fields of neurology and cardiology. In neurology, theranostic approaches offer new avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and  multiple sclerosis. Advanced imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), allow for the visualization of neuroanatomy, functional connectivity, and molecular changes in the brain. This enables early detection, precise diagnosis, and monitoring of disease progression, facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. Similarly, in cardiology, theranostics play a significant role in the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular conditions. Non-invasive imaging modalities like MRI and computed tomography (CT) provide detailed information about cardiac structure, function, and blood flow, aiding in the assessment of heart disease and the guidance of interventions. Theranostic approaches in cardiology involve targeted drug delivery systems for the treatment of conditions such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, as well as image-guided interventions for precise stenting or catheter-based therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Research directions ===\n",
      "Several challenges remain to be addressed for widespread adoption and integration of theranostics into routine clinical practice. Regulatory considerations will play a role in ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of theranostic agents and technologies. Harmonization of regulations across different countries and regions is necessary to facilitate global implementation. Cost-effectiveness is a significant challenge, as theranostic approaches can be expensive. Strategies to optimize resource utilization and reimbursement models have been discussed. Technical limitations, such as the development of more specific and sensitive imaging agents, improvement of imaging resolution and quality, and the integration of different imaging modalities, require ongoing research and technological advancements. Ethical considerations surrounding patient privacy, data security, and the responsible use of patient information need to be addressed.\n",

      "\n",
      "The human climate niche is the ensemble of climate conditions that have sustained human life and human activities, like agriculture, on the globe for the last millennia. The human climate niche is estimated by calculating the human population density with respect to mean annual temperature. The human population distribution as a function of mean annual temperature is bimodal and results in two modes; one at 15 °C and another one at ~20 to 25 °C. Crops and livestock required for sustaining the human population are also limited to the similar niche conditions. Given the rise in mean global temperatures, the human population is projected to experience climate conditions beyond the human climate niche. Some projections show that considering temperature and demographic changes, 2.0 and 3.7 billion people will live in out of the niche by 2030 and 2090, respectively.\n",

      "\n",
      "Dasypoda radchenkoi, also known as Radchenko's pantaloon bee, is a species of solitary bee from the family Melittidae. It was described in 2023 in the scientific journal Osmia based on specimens caught in the limestone areas of southern Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Description ==\n",
      "Dasypoda radchenkoi is a medium-size, solitary Hymenoptera from the species-poor family Melittidae, a wild bee family comprising approximately 150 species globally. The species is near cryptic with the Iberian pantaloon bee Dasypoda morotei, which means that the morphology is both species is highly similar and hardly allows their differentiation. Although tiny morphological features allow to distinguish the females of both species, males remain unidentifiable based on visual examination only. The discovery of Dasypoda radchenkoi as a separate species was initially fortuitous via the genetic barcoding of two specimens, one being the holotype female and the other being a paratype male. The species is only known from the limestone mountains of southern Spain, from where it is thought to be endemic. The species flies in May and June and collects floral resources on plants of the genus Cistus (Cistaceae).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Taxonomy ==\n",
      "The genus Dasypoda is divided into four subgenera that allow the classification of most species globally: Dasypoda sensu stricto (the group of the common pantaloon bee Dasypoda hirtipes ), Heterodasypoda (including the Iberian Dasypoda morotei ), Microdasypoda (the group of small-sized pantaloon bee Dasypoda crassicornis ) and Megadasypoda (the group of the large-sized pantaloon bees such as Dasypoda vulpecula ). The morphology of Dasypoda radchenkoi is typical of the subgenus Heterodasypoda. The phylogenetic position of the species shows that it is the sister species of the near cryptic Dasypoda morotei, as it could be expected based on morphology alone. After the formal description if D. radchenkoi at the University of Mons, the holotype female was sent to the Museum of Linz, in Austria, where it now hosted. Some paratypes were sent to the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, in The Netherlands.\n",
      "\n",

      "== Etymology ==\n",
      "The species is dedicated to Prof. Vladimir G. Radchenko, worldwide authority on the ecology and taxonomy of bees, and head of the Department of General Biology at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Conservation ==\n",
      "Based on the guidelines of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Dasypoda radchenkoi was assessed \"Data Deficient\" based on two arguments: no information about the possible threats to the species is known, and the complete distribution of the species is yet to be assessed. More surveys in southern Spain are necessary to understand more in detail the ecology and biogeography of the species.\n",

The species of octopus is regarded as having a relatively high grade based on size, texture, and taste; thought in part to be a result of its natural diet in the local environment. Products made by the fishery include frozen raw tentacles, steamed tentacles, and marinated octopus.\n",
      "The business processes octopus catch from various independently owned boats, and has a processing plant in the suburb of O'Connor. The business' founder Craig Cammilleri has been credited as the inventor of the 'octopus trigger trap', a method for catching octopus that uses a plastic grab with an in-built LED light to lure octopus. Baby octopus and fish are not strong enough to trigger the trap.\n",
      "The business operates in a fishery with Marine Stewardship Council certification, one of only two octopus fisheries in the world where that is the case. The total catch of Octopus djinda in WA is around 300 tonnes per year, of which Fremantle Octopus processes around 70%. Estimates have placed the sustainable catch rate for the fishery at around 1-2 thousand tonnes per year. Prior to being a valuable commodity, octopus were an annoyance for rock lobster fisherman as a predator of their catch.\n",
      "Around 80% of the fishery's catch is sold domestically in Australia, with 20% exported to foreign markets including the US, Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai. In 2019 the business expanded its exports to the Chinese market.\n",

Shen Tong also helped established Radio Free Asia with bipartisan efforts led by then Senator Joe Biden in the 1990s. American NGO activist Marshall Strauss and program coordinator Juanita Scheyett-Cheng helped Shen found and operate the Fund. Coretta Scott King, John Kerry, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Nancy Pelosi, Kerry Kennedy, among other Western political and NGO figures and sinologists, were associated with Shen's organization in the 1990s.  The Congressional Human Rights Delegation to China in 1991 headed by Nancy Pelosi and Republican congressman John R. Miller was organized by the Democracy for China Fund with the help and funding from Hong Kong Democrats. His 1992 trip back to China led to his and his associates' arrest. He was released and immediately exiled after two months of imprisonment under mounting international pressure, particularly from the US Congress, the Presidential Campaign of Bill Clinton, the Vatican, and European governments. In May 1993, days before the renewal of China's Most Favored Nation trading status by the US government, Shen was scheduled to give a speech at the United Nations press club, but was barred by UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali due to strong protest from the Chinese government.

      "The Zubaydah Trail (Al-Kufi pilgrimage route) is among the seven major pilgrimage routes in the Arabian Peninsula, dating back over 1000 years. A crucial trade route during the Abbasid era, it is a strong candidate for the UNESCO World Heritage List. This historical trail was constructed to serve pilgrims from Iraq, neighbouring Islamic countries, and East Asian countries.\n",
      "Its construction was completed during the Abbasid Caliphate, specifically between 132 AH (750 CE) and 656 AH (1258 CE). \n",
      "The trail's history dates back to the pre-Islamic era, when it was used by tribes, travellers, and commercial caravans to move between Iraq and Western Arabia. Over time, its usage became regular and easier as the water centres, grazing areas, and mining locations along the route transformed into major stations.\n",
      "During the Abbasid era, the trail served as an important link between Baghdad, the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula. The Abbasid caliphs took great interest in the trail, enhanced it with various benefits and facilities, as well as undertook an expansion of the road to make it suitable for use by pilgrims, travellers, and their animals.\n",
      "Historical, geographical, and archaeological sources show that the trail route was designed in a practical and meticulous manner. Along its length from Kufa to Mecca, stations, houses, and resting areas were established. Its surface was paved with stones in sandy and muddy areas. In addition, it was equipped with necessary amenities and facilities such as wells, ponds, and dams. Signages, lighthouses, beacons, and stoves were also set up to mark its path and guide travellers.\n",
      "The Zubaydah Trail stretches over a distance of 1,300 kilometres and is connected to 27 main stations, most of which are concentrated in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, 58 subsidiary stations called Muta'asha, which are rest stops, were established between every two main stations. The average distance between each main station and the next is approximately 50 kilometres.\n",

She made significant contributions towards the construction of the trail, and alongside her husband, dedicated a considerable amount of their wealth towards the comfort of pilgrims and travellers. The idea for establishing the trail came after she experienced great hardships on her journey to perform the Hajj pilgrimage in the year 176 AH.

It was inaugurated by Mir Kamaluddin Hussainkhan, the last Nawab of Baroda. During the rule of Gaekwad, it was a stoppage for horse drawn trams. The clock tower was erected at the cost of ₹25,000 (equivalent to ₹9.3 million or US$120,000 in 2023). It was constructed from the funds raised by the citizens of Baroda State.\n",
      "The premises of the tower were rented by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation for the last three decades. In 2017, the municipal commissioner, Vinod Rao, ordered to vacate the tower to conserve it as a heritage monument. The mechanical system of the tower clock was replaced by DC motor.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Accident ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The flight took off from Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport at 10:33 am NST. It crashed on the bank of the Seti Gandaki River while on final approach to landing at Pokhara International Airport. A video filmed from the ground showed the aircraft banking steeply to the left before crashing 65 metres (213 ft) away. Another video of the crash was streamed live on Facebook from inside the plane by a passenger, Sonu Jaiswal, showing that the passengers were unaware of the situation until seconds before impact.\n",
      "The crash occurred in Gandaki Province between the old Pokhara Airport and the new Pokhara International Airport, which was opened two weeks earlier and also where the aircraft was intending to land. The accident resulted in the deaths of all 72 people on board, and was Nepal's worst aviation accident since the crash of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 268 in 1992, the deadliest aviation accident in Nepalese domestic aviation, and the deadliest accident involving an ATR 72.\n",
      "According to an official at the Pokhara International Airport, air traffic control cleared the flight to land on runway 30 heading from east to west, but the captain requested the opposing runway 12 heading from west to east, minutes before the crash. Flight-tracking service Flightradar24 noted that during the flight the aircraft had been transmitting inaccurate speed and altitude data.\n",

Seventy-one bodies were found. On 17 January, authorities began returning the victims' bodies (the majority of which were burnt beyond recognition) to their families. The United States Department of State announced that two U.S. citizens died in the crash, although Nepalese authorities did not report any American deaths.\n",
      "The plane was under the command of senior captain Kamal KC with Anju Khatiwada as copilot. Khatiwada's husband, Dipak Pokhrel, who also worked for Yeti Airlines, died in the 2006 Yeti Airlines Twin Otter crash.

      "== Investigation ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts noted that the video from the ground taken moments before the crash showed the aircraft's nose noticeably high before the left wing suddenly dropped, probably indicating a stall. Hours after the crash, a five-member committee headed by Nagendra Ghimire was set up to investigate the accident in conjunction with the French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety.\n",
      "On 16 January, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders were found; the recorders were examined in Singapore and with assistance from Transportation Safety Board of Canada, Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety, and Transport Safety Investigation Bureau of Singapore. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Preliminary report ===\n",
      "About a month later, on 13 February, a preliminary report was released, which largely reproduced all relevant logs.\n",
      "\n",
      "(PF = Pilot Flying, PM = Pilot Monitoring):At 10:56:27, the PF disengaged the Autopilot System (AP) at an altitude of 721 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The PF then called for \"FLAPS 30\" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, \"Flaps 30 and descending\". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap surface movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition [...] \n",
      "The flight crew then carried out the \"Before Landing Checklist\" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At this point, the Np of both propellers was recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines was at 0%. When propellers are in feather, they are not producing thrust [...]\n",
      "At 10:56:54, another click was heard, followed by the flaps surface movement to the 30 degrees position [...]\n",
      "\n",
      "When ATC gave the clearance for landing at 10:57:07, the PF mentioned twice that there was no power coming from the engines. At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. At 10:57:20, the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines [...]\n",
      "The aircraft's propellers had been feathered for about a minute before the crash, causing the engine to produce no thrust and lead the aircraft into a stall; the condition levers, which control the propellers, were discovered from the wreckage set to the feathered position. Seconds preceding the crash, the pilots discussed a total lack of power and even moved the power lever to the extreme but failed to recognize that the condition levers were incorrectly set. That the condition levers and the flap lever are next to each other in an ATR 72, experts speculate that the monitoring pilot (Kamal KC) had inadvertently moved the former in place of the latter, when asked of by the flying pilot. While, about twenty seconds later, he would set the flap lever properly on his own, he failed to account for his previous mistake, implying that the landing checklist was not properly followed.\n",
      "Due to the shortened final approach leg for runway 12 for this flight and another flight three days before it that landed on the same runway, the stabilization criteria for a visual approach, which is important for a safe landing, was not met at the height of 500 ft above ground level. This led the Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission to recommend the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) conduct a comprehensive study for the determination of an appropriate flight path that allows a stabilized visual approach.\n",
      "On 15 March, the Government of Nepal extended the deadline by 45 days to the investigation commission for the final report of the accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Final report ===\n",
      "On 28 December 2023, the final report was released. It reiterated the preliminary findings that the accidental change of position of both condition levers to the feathered position resulted in the loss of thrust, leading to the aerodynamic stall and crash. Some other contributing factors are also found, mostly human errors due to a high workload, lack of appropriate technical and skill-based training, ineffective crew resource management (CRM), lack of sterile cockpit discipline, and the non-compliance with standard operating procedures (SOP).\n",

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Roma, Njikam said the fact was perceived as \"an act of racism\" as \"the embassy justified the refusal by claiming that there were no guarantees that I would leave Italian territory once I entered, in Venice. They basically treated me as a migrant, as if I wanted to take advantage of the situation to escape. But I have a job, a professional card from the Moroccan Film Center. And, frankly, if I wanted to work in Europe, I would have already done so,\" and that the entity \"did not look at my resume or my documents, only the color of my skin. [...] This problem exists only with the Italian embassy in Morocco, because my colleagues from Ghana and the Ivory Coast were able to leave. If I had been white, I don't think I would have been treated this way.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Myosotis angustata is a species of flowering plant in the family Boraginaceae, endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. Thomas Cheeseman described the species in 1906. Plants of this species of forget-me-not are perennial rosettes with ebracteate inflorescences and white corollas with stamens that are wholly exserted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Description ==\n",
      "M. angustata plants are rosettes. The rosette leaves have broad petioles that difficult to distinguish from the leaf blades. The rosette leaves are about 20 mm long by 4 mm wide (length: width ratio 5: 1), usually linear-spathulate and widest at or above the middle, with an subacute apex. Both surfaces of the leaf are uniformly and densely covered in appressed hairs, with lower density on the lower surface. Each rosette has several ascending to erect, ebracteate inflorescences that are up to 150 mm long. The cauline leaves are similar to the rosette leaves, but become smaller, are linear or narrow-oblong and subacute, and have hairs similar to the rosette leaves. The flowers are many per inflorescence, and each is borne on a short pedicel, each with a bract.\n",
      "\n",
      "The calyx is 5–8 mm long at flowering and fruiting, lobed to one-half of its length, and densely covered in straight hairs, as well as some hooked hairs, all of which are antrorse. The corolla is white and about 7 mm in diameter, with a cylindrical tube, and small scales alternating with the petals. The anthers are exserted with the anthers surpassing the faucal scales. The nutlets are 2.2 mm long by 1 mm wide. Flowering and fruiting occur in January.\n",

      "The original specimens (syntypes) of this species were collected by Cheeseman in \"Mt Arthur Plateau and Raglan Mountains\", South Island, New Zealand. The specimens collected by Cheeseman are housed at the herbarium of the Auckland War Memorial Museum (AK).\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Description ==\n",
      "Mount Brown is the highest point in the county, highest point of the East Butte complex, and second-highest peak in the Sweet Grass Hills. It is situated 26 miles (42 km) north of Chester, Montana, and eight miles (13 km) south of the Canada–United States border. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north to the Milk River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 3,000 feet (910 meters) above the surrounding plains in four miles (6.4 km) which makes it a prominent landmark visible for many miles. The slopes provide habitat for elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Geology ==\n",
      "Mount Brown is an exposed laccolith composed of syenitic  and monzonitic trachytes created by an igneous intrusion through older Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks during the Eocene, about 50 million years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily shale and siltstone. Over time, erosion of the sedimentary rock has exposed the solidified laccolith which is more resistant to weathering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== History ==\n",
      "The Sweet Grass Hills, which are centered in buffalo hunting territory, are sacred to the Blackfoot and other tribes. The Blackfoot called East Butte \"pinapitsékatúyis\" which means \"east side sweet pine.\" In 1806, Meriwether Lewis sighted the mountains from the Missouri River, which is 100 miles (160 km) distant, and George Mercer Dawson reported seeing them from 140 miles (230 km) away at Blackfoot Crossing in Alberta. The landform's toponym has been officially adopted by the United States Board on Geographic Names.\n",

      "== Climate ==\n",
      "Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Brown is located in a semi-arid climate zone with long, cold, dry winters and hot summers with cool nights. Winter temperatures can drop below −10 °F with wind chill factors below −30 °F. The wettest period of the year is generally May through August, with up to 20 inches of precipitation falling annually on the peak. \n",

      "The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was a railroad running from Boykins, Virginia south to Lewiston, North Carolina, a distance of 36 miles.\n",
      "The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was chartered by the North Carolina State Legislature in 1871 though no action to construct the line happened until 1885, when the charter was reissued.  It would operate as a subsidiary of the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad, which it connected with at the north end in Boykins.  Construction began in 1887 and was complete a year later.\n",
      "In 1892, the Murfreesboro Railroad was built, which branched off the Roanoke and Tar River Railroad at Pendleton and ran to Murfreesboro, North Carolina.  The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad would acquire the Murfreesboro Railroad in 1893 and operated it as a branch line until 1897.  When they discontinued service on the branch, the town of Murfreesboro took action to prevent the abandonment.  But in the late evening of May 7, 1897, the company removed the branch's tracks in the dark of the night.\n",
      "By the end of the 1800s, the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway network.  The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was fully merged into the Seaboard Air Line in 1911.  The line would operate as the Seaboard Air Line's Lewiston Subdivision.\n",
      "In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line merged with its rival, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL).  The merged company was named the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL).  The Lewiston Subdivision connected with an ex-ACL line in Kelford.  In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System, creating the CSX Corporation.  The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation.\n",
      "The southernmost five miles of the line from Kelford to Lewiston was abandoned sometime after 1986.  The remaining line from Boykins to Kelford was sold to the North Carolina and Virginia Railroad in 1987, who operates the line today.\n",

      "The Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act is a proposed United States congressional bill introduced in the 118th United States Congress. Introduced in response to the national opioid epidemic, the legislation would expand access to methadone, an approved medication for treating opioid use disorder (OUD).\n",
      "The bill would give pharmacies the ability to provide methadone to patients with OUD, which can currently only be accessed at methadone clinics. Additionally, the bill would allow approved healthcare providers to prescribe take-home doses for OUD patients. \n",

      "Classified as a schedule II substance, OUD patients are only permitted to access the medication at opioid treatment facilities (OTPs), known as methadone clinics. Patients are generally required to visit clinics in-person to receive daily doses of methadone, and are usually prevented from receiving \"take-home\" doses.  \n",
      "Critics of these regulations note that while pharmacies are prohibited from dispensing methadone, they are permitted to dispense the same medication for pain. However, opponents of relaxing regulations on methadone treatment for OUD argue that expanding access could lead to misuse of methadone.\n",

      "\n",
      "Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, called the Wolf of Badenoch (1343 – July 1394), was a Scottish royal prince, the third son of King Robert II of Scotland by his first wife Elizabeth Mure. He was Justiciar of Scotia and held large territories in the north of Scotland. He is perhaps best remembered for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its cathedral. His sobriquet was earned due to his notorious cruelty and rapacity, but there is no proof that it was used during his lifetime. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Power and influence ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Known in charters as Alexander Senescalli (Latin for Steward), first noted when, on 14 August 1370, he issued letters patent from Ruthven Castle undertaking to grant protection to the Bishop of Moray and all of his lands, men and property in Badenoch. His father, Robert the Steward, had acquired the lands of Badenoch probably from Euphemia, Countess of Moray who had become his second wife. \n",
      "Robert had a petulant relationship with his uncle, King David II of Scotland. In 1368, he and his sons were required by David's parliament to take an oath that they would keep their undisciplined followers in check—later that year, Robert and Alexander were imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle possibly as a result of these oaths having been broken. Following Robert's accession to the throne, Alexander was formally made Lord of Badenoch on 30 March 1371.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alexander's possession of Badenoch was unaffected by the restoration of the Earldom of Moray to John Dunbar in March 1372, nor were the territories of John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, in Lochaber—similarly with the lands of Urquhart (south of Inverness) which had been granted to David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn and King Robert's eldest son with his second wife, Euphemia. Alexander further extended his territorial gains in 1371 by leasing the Urquhart lands from his younger half-brother and then obtained possession of the Barony of Strathavon bordering his Badenoch lands. \n",
      "In October 1372, Alexander was given the Royal Lieutenancy for those lands outwith the Earldom of Moray north and west of Inverness and added lands in Aberdeenshire and north Perthshire. In the same year, he was Royal Justiciar in the Appin of Dull in Perthshire which meant that Alexander held crown authority from north Perthshire to the Pentland Firth.\n",
      "Alexander de Ard, a principal claimant for the Earldom of Caithness as the eldest grandson of Earl Malise, resigned his territories to the crown in favour of both Alexander and his half-brother David. However Alexander effectively doubled his land holdings when he married Euphemia Countess of Ross, in June 1382. \n",
      "Alexander became the jure uxoris Earl of Ross and this provided him the Ross lands (but only during his own lifetime). Other lands belonging to his wife – including Lewis, Skye, Dingwall and Kingedward in Aberdeenshire – he held in joint ownership with her. His possession of the Barony of Kingedward, a large part of the former Earldom of Buchan allowed King Robert to give Alexander the title of Earl of Buchan only days after his marriage. Alexander ruled these territories with the help of his own private cateran forces, building up resentment among other land owners and this included Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Church defiance ==\n",
      "\n",
      "There was no dominant potentate in Moray during the 12th and 13th centuries and the bishops ruled their territories with a great deal of independence, but this ended when King Robert I of Scotland elevated his nephew Thomas Randolph to the Earldom of Moray sometime between 12 April and 29 October 1312. The Randolph family did not hold the Earldom for long and it reverted to the crown on the death of Thomas's son John, in 1346, and lay vacant for the next 26 years. In 1365, bishop Bur persuaded David II that his lands in Badenoch and Strathspey should be governed as if in regality. To emphasise this, Bur, when he entered into the protection agreement with Alexander in 1370, ensured that the de facto Lord of Badenoch would have no hold on him, nor his lands and people. \n",
      "A few months later in March 1371, on his father's accession to the throne, Alexander was officially made Lord of Badenoch. Robert II's charter gave Alexander the lands of Badenoch seemingly in regality with, presumably, authority over the church lands however, bishop Bur possibly protested at this, as the details of the grant of Badenoch contained in the Register of the Great Seal has no reference to regality. \n",
      "Alexander was therefore to hold the Badenoch lands with no greater authority than John Comyn had a century before. The bishop continued to come under pressure from Alexander either directly or from his caterans possibly acting independently. Boardman explains that both the bishops of Moray and Aberdeen were in dispute with Alexander regarding the strain that his cateran followers were putting on church lands and tenants. \n",
      "Boardman also theorises that it was this occupation of church lands, virtually rendering them worthless in terms of income, that may have been the reason for Bur 'voluntarily' giving up his rights to estates such as Rothiemurchas, on 20 April 1382. Complicating matters was the fact that neither of the bishops could appeal to the 'legitimate secular authority' as that authority was Alexander himself in his positions of Lord of Badenoch and Royal Lieutenant and was the reason why they appealed directly to the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Increasing pressure ==\n",
      "\n",
      "King Robert's reputation declined because of his backing Buchan's methods and so in November 1384, John, Earl of Carrick with the backing of the general council, took executive authority from his father with lawlessness in the north being a major issue. The Lordship of Strathnairn had been administered by Buchan with the approval of the King, but now under Carrick's leadership, Sir David Lindsay was able to reassert his right to Strathnairn. \n",
      "In April 1385, at the council, Buchan's brother David claimed that Buchan was holding Urquhart unlawfully, while Sir James Lindsay of Crawford reinstated his claim to the Lordship of Buchan and finally, the Earl of Moray demanded that some of Buchan's men be prosecuted for the killing of some of his men. Despite these early attacks on his position, Buchan significantly strengthened his territorial position, especially in the Great Glen where he retained Urquhart after his brother's death and then in the autumn of 1386 he gained the lands of Bona at the head of Loch Ness from the Earl of Moray and the adjoining lands in Abriachin from Sir Robert Chisholm. \n",
      "Buchan's increased influence in Scottish affairs was again furthered when sometime before February 1387, he was appointed Justiciar North of the Forth Carrick's guardianship of Scotland had not been a success and certainly failed to rein in Buchan and so late in 1388, King Robert's second son, Robert, Earl of Fife (Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany) became the effective ruler of the Kingdom. \n",
      "Within days, Fife removed Buchan from the Justiciarship and, it is assumed, the Royal Lieutenancy and the Sheriffdom of Inverness and later installed his own son, Murdoch as Justiciar North of the Forth. Fife was very uncompromising towards Buchan, who had been described as 'useless to the community' at a previous general council meeting. Buchan had long deserted his wife and lived with Mairead inghean Eachainn with whom he had several children, including Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Marital law was the prerogative of the Church and so on 2 November 1389, Bishop Alexander Bur of Moray and Bishop Alexander Kylquhous of Ross, ordered his return to his wife, Euphemia. Buchan agreed to this but didn't live up to his promise and so Fife encouraged Euphemia of Ross during her divorce proceedings against Buchan and, in 1392, Euphemia was successful in her appeal to the Avignon papal court and his marriage was annulled. Following the annulment, Buchan lost all claim to Euphemia's lands which returned to her and to her son Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross who contracted to marry Fife's daughter.\n",

      "\n",
      "King Robert II died at Dundonald Castle in Ayrshire on 19 April 1390 and the chronicler Wyntoun informs that Robert was not buried at Scone until 13 August 1390, only a day before his son John, Earl of Carrick was crowned King as Robert III. Fife was retained as Guardian of Scotland probably much against Buchan's hopes as he must have looked at some sort of volte-face on some of Fife's actions, particularly as Buchan reached his zenith of possessions under Carrick. On top of this, Bishop Bur turned to Thomas Dunbar, Sheriff of Inverness and son of the Earl of Moray to provide his protection. The events of May and June 1390 in the Laich of Moray were perhaps the result of a combination of factors that presented themselves to Buchan. Firstly, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and his fellow northern landowner Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk both absented themselves from Moray to attend a substantial tourney at Richard II of England's court. In addition, Bishop Bur's involvement with Buchan's estrangement with his wife and then Bur's alignment with Moray presented an opportunity for revenge culminating in the destruction of Forres in May and then Elgin with its cathedral in June. His destruction of the church possessions in Elgin was complete—as well as the cathedral, the monastery of the Greyfriars, St Giles parish church and the Hospital of Maison Dieu were all put to flame. Church and state now came together to oppose him—excommunicated by Bur, Buchan had to appear at the Church of the Friars Preacher, in Perth in the presence of his brothers, King Robert III of Scotland and the Earl of Fife, and the council-general to plead for forgiveness—absolution was granted by bishop Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews.\n",
      "Buchan's brutal assault on Moray in 1390 was to some extent intended to extricate himself from Fife's domination but turned out to be unsuccessful—Alexander was to lose his Lordship of Urquhart in 1392 and then his claim on Ross following his wife's divorce in 1392. Fife's influence waned during the mid-1390s while that of King Robert and his son David, Earl of Carrick increased—the King took back responsibility for Scottish-English relations and had manoeuvred the Red Douglas Earl of Angus into a dominating position in southeastern Scotland at the expense of Fife's ally, the Black Douglas. Although Fife's authority over Scottish affairs had lessened he still exercised considerable power in government. Fife and Carrick both campaigned against Buchan and his sons and other lawless elements in the west and north. Although Buchan appeared to have halted his violent traits after this, his sons did not. A fight ensued near Pitlochry involving Duncan and Robert Stewart at the head of a band of caterans when Sir Walter Ogilvie and Walter de Lychton and followers were killed. Later it is recorded that three sons of Buchan were imprisoned in Stirling Castle from 1396 to 1402, perhaps the reason for Buchan's low profile during the later 1390s.\n",
      "Buchan is again mentioned at Spynie Castle on 3 May 1398 being ordered to deliver it up to William, bishop of Moray by Robert III. Buchan appears to have left the north in his latter years appearing as Baillie of the Earldom of Atholl in 1402 and a mention in 1404 in Perth. However, several sources indicate he died in July 1394, which causes one to wonder to whom is being referred in 1398 and 1404 if not his son by the same name.\n",
      "Buchan having acquired vast territories in the north lost a large part of them during his own lifetime (lands of Ross and Urquhart). He held royal appointments only to have them removed (Justiciar of Scotia and Royal Lieutenant north of the Moray Firth.) He was unsuccessful in maintaining law and order and this seen alongside his inability to hold onto his Ross territories demonstrated his ineffectiveness. He died circa 20 July 1405 and was buried at Cathedral of Dunkeld, Perthshire. His chest tomb, topped by an effigy in armour, is one of the few Scottish royal monuments to have survived from the Middle Ages.\n",

      "There is a legend that Stewart—the \"Wolf of Badenoch\"—died after a chess game with the Devil. According to this legend, Stewart was visited at Ruthven Castle by a tall man dressed in black. The two played chess through the night, with a storm rising when the stranger called \"Check\" and \"Check Mate\". The legend says that the next morning the Wolf of Badenoch was found dead in the castle's hall, with his men dead outside the castle walls. \n",

      "According to historian Angus Mackay, Alexander Stewart the Wolf of Badenoch's mistress, Mairead inghean Eachainn, was, in fact, Mariota Mackay, daughter of Iye Mackay, 4th of Strathnaver. There is however no evidence for this assertion. Stewart and Mairead had several illegitimate children, including Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar.\n",
      "The Mackay historian explains that Mariota Mackay who is described in Latin as \"Mariota filia Athyn\", being the \"handfasted\" wife of Alexander Stewart the Wolf of Badenoch, would explain Stewart's friendship with Farquhar Mackay who was Mariota Mackay's brother and physician to Robert II of Scotland. It would also explain why a party of Mackay's supported Stewart the Wolf of Badenoch in a raid into the Braes of Angus in 1391. It may well also have served as a motive for Angus Du Mackay, 7th of Strathnaver having supported Alexander Stewart the Earl of Mar, son of the Wolf, at the Battle of Dingwall in 1411 against Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles, as Mackay and Stewart the Earl of Mar would have been cousins.\n",

      "Siege of Mariupol\n",
      "\n",
      "The siege of Mariupol began on 24 February 2022 and lasted until 20 May, as part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It saw fighting between the Russian Armed Forces (alongside the Donetsk People's Republic People's Militia) and the Ukrainian Armed Forces for control over the city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine. Lasting for almost three months, the siege ended in a victory for Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic, as Ukraine lost control of the city amidst Russia's eastern Ukraine offensive and southern Ukraine offensive; all Ukrainian troops remaining in the city surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works on 20 May 2022, after they were ordered to cease fighting.\n",
      "Mariupol is located in Ukraine's Donetsk Oblast, and following the siege, it was initially controlled by the Donetsk People's Republic, supported by occupying Russian troops. However, it was later subjected to Russia's unilateral annexation of southeastern Ukraine, and remains under direct Russian control as of 10 May 2023.\n",
      "During the Russian siege, the Red Cross described the situation in Mariupol as \"apocalyptic\" while Ukrainian authorities accused Russia of engineering a major humanitarian crisis in the city. Ukrainian officials reported that approximately 25,000 civilians had been killed and that at least 95% of the city had been destroyed during the fighting, primarily by large-scale Russian bombardments. In an official statement, the United Nations confirmed the deaths of 1,348 civilians in Mariupol, but warned that the true death toll was likely thousands higher while also reporting that 90% of the city's residential buildings had been damaged or completely destroyed.\n",
      "Major combat operations in the city effectively ended on 16 May 2022, after Ukraine's Azov Regiment surrendered at the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works. Some Western reports described the siege as a pyrrhic or symbolic Russian victory, with others noting that the humanitarian impact of the takeover was a \"reputational disaster\" for Russia. However, the loss of the city has also been seen as a significant defeat for Ukraine.\n",
      "Based on the analysis of mass graves, Human Rights Watch estimated at least 10,284 people died in Mariupol from March 2022 to February 2023, but assumes that is an undercount.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Mariupol was considered a major strategic city and therefore was a target for Russian forces. It was the largest city in the Ukrainian-controlled portion of Donetsk Oblast, and was also one of the largest Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Mariupol was a major industrial hub, home of the Illich and Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, and the largest city on the Sea of Azov.\n",
      "Control of its port on the western shore of the Sea of Azov is vital to the economy of Ukraine. For Russia, it would allow a land route to Crimea and allow passage by Russian marine traffic. Capturing the city gave Russia full control over the Sea of Azov.\n",
      "In 2014 after the Revolution of Dignity, Mariupol was swept by pro-Russian protests against the new government. Tensions erupted into the war in Donbas in early May, and during the unrest, militiamen of the separatist and Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) took control of the city and forced Ukrainian troops to abandon it during the first battle for Mariupol. However, the following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the city in an offensive. In August, the DPR and Russian troops captured the village of Novoazovsk, 45 km east of Mariupol near the Russo-Ukrainian border. With the town captured and forces renewed, in September the DPR attempted to capture the city again in the second battle for Mariupol. Fighting reached the eastern outskirts, but the separatists were eventually repelled. In October, then-DPR Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko vowed to retake the city. Mariupol was then indiscriminately bombed by rockets in January 2015. Fearing a future third offensive into Mariupol, in February Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack into Shyrokyne, a village located 11 km east of Mariupol with the objective of expelling the separatist forces from the city limits and creating a buffer zone. The separatists withdrew from Shyrokyne four months later. The conflict was frozen when the Minsk II ceasefire agreement was signed in 2015.\n",
      "2018 saw again tension in the region around Mariupol, as the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) coast guard fired upon and captured three Ukrainian Navy vessels after they attempted to transit from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov through the Kerch Strait on their way to the port of Mariupol. The Kerch Strait incident raised tensions, and martial law was briefly declared by Ukraine in fears that a war would break out between the two countries.\n",
      "One of the most instrumental groups for the recapture and subsequent defenses of Mariupol was the Azov Battalion, a Ukrainian volunteer militia, controversial for its openly neo-Nazi and ultranationalist members. By November 2014 Azov was integrated into the National Guard of Ukraine, with Mariupol as its headquarters. As one of Vladimir Putin's stated goals for the invasion was the \"denazification\" of Ukraine, Mariupol represented an important ideological and symbolical target for the Russian forces.\n",
      "Prior to the siege, around 100,000 residents left Mariupol, according to the city's deputy mayor.\n",
      "Prior to falling to Russian forces, the city was defended by the Ukrainian Ground Forces, the Ukrainian Naval Infantry, the National Guard of Ukraine (primarily the Azov Regiment), the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine, and irregular forces.\n",

      "On 24 February, the day the invasion began, Russian artillery bombarded the city, reportedly injuring 26 people.\n",
      "On the morning of 25 February, Russian forces advanced from DPR territory in the east towards Mariupol. They encountered Ukrainian forces near the village of Pavlopil, who repelled the Russian advance. The mayor of Mariupol, Vadym Boychenko, said 22 Russian tanks had been destroyed in the skirmish. That evening, the Russian Navy, drawing on the capabilities provided by the Black Sea Fleet, reportedly began an amphibious assault on the Sea of Azov coastline 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defense official stated that the Russians may have deployed thousands of marines from this beachhead.\n",
      "On 26 February, Russian forces continued to bombard Mariupol with artillery. Later, the government of Greece announced that ten ethnic Greek civilians had been killed by Russian strikes at Mariupol, six in the village of Sartana and four in the village of Buhas.\n",
      "On the morning of 27 February, mayor Boychenko said that a Russian tank column had advanced on Mariupol from the DPR, but this attack was repulsed by Ukrainian forces, with six Russian soldiers captured. Later that day, a 6-year-old girl in Mariupol was killed by Russian shelling. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of Donetsk Oblast, stated that fighting in Mariupol had continued throughout the night of 27 February.\n",
      "Throughout 28 February, the city remained under Ukrainian control despite being surrounded by Russian troops and constantly shelled. Electricity, gas, and internet connection to most of the city was cut during the evening. Later, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Russian Major General Andrei Sukhovetsky was killed by a Ukrainian sniper near Mariupol, but other sources said that he had been killed during the Kyiv offensive.\n",

      "=== Mariupol surrounded ===\n",
      "\n",
      "On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, the head of the DPR, announced that DPR forces had almost completely surrounded the nearby city of Volnovakha and that they would soon do the same to Mariupol. Russian artillery later bombarded Mariupol, causing over 21 injuries.\n",
      "The city was fully surrounded on 2 March, after which the siege intensified. Russian shelling killed a teenager and wounded two other teenagers who were playing soccer outside. Boychenko announced the city was suffering from a water outage and had experienced massive casualties. He also said Russian forces were preventing civilians from exiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on 2 March, Russian artillery targeted a densely populated neighborhood of Mariupol, shelling it for nearly 15 hours. The neighborhood was massively damaged as a result, with deputy mayor Sergiy Orlov reporting that \"at least hundreds of people are dead\".\n",
      "On the morning of 3 March, the city was shelled again by Russian troops. Eduard Basurin, the spokesman for the DPR militia, formally called on the besieged Ukrainian forces in Mariupol to surrender or face \"targeted strikes\". Russian Ministry of Defense spokesman Igor Konashenkov reported that DPR forces had tightened the siege, and that three nearby settlements had been captured.\n",
      "On 4 March, Boychenko stated that the city's supplies were running out, and called for a humanitarian evacuation corridor and Ukrainian military reinforcements. He also stated that Russian BM-21 Grads were shelling the city's hospitals and that Mariupol residents no longer had heat, running water, or electricity. Later that day, a temporary ceasefire was proposed for the Mariupol region in order to allow citizens to evacuate.\n",
      "On 5 March, the Ukrainian government announced its desire to evacuate 200,000 civilians from Mariupol. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced that it would act as a guarantor for a new ceasefire to allow for this evacuation. The Red Cross described the situation in Mariupol as \"extremely dire\". After three days of shelling, a ceasefire was announced to be in effect from 11:00 to 16:00. Civilians began to evacuate from Mariupol along a humanitarian corridor to the city of Zaporizhzhia. As civilians entered the evacuation corridor, Russian forces continued shelling the city, forcing evacuees to turn back.\n",
      "Ukrainian authorities later reported that Russian forces had failed to observe the ceasefire and continued to shell the city. Russian officials accused Ukrainian forces of not allowing civilians to evacuate towards Russia. The DPR reported that only 17 civilians had been evacuated from Mariupol.\n",
      "On 6 March, the Red Cross announced that a second attempt to evacuate civilians from Mariupol had again failed. Anton Herashchenko, a Ukrainian official, said the second attempt at a humanitarian corridor for civilians in Mariupol ended with a Russian bombardment. The Red Cross reported that there were \"devastating scenes of human suffering\" in Mariupol. Later in the morning, Inna Sovsun, a Ukrainian member of parliament, stated that the fuel pipeline that supplies Mariupol was damaged by Russian forces, leaving more than 700,000 people without heat, and suggested that people might freeze to death, as the temperature at the time often fell below 0 °C (32 °F). The bombardment also hit the city's last functioning cellular tower.\n",
      "On 7 March, the ICRC Director of Operations stated that humanitarian corridor agreements had only been made in principle, without the precision required for implementation, needing routes, times and whether goods could be brought in to be agreed. The ICRC team had found that one of the proposed corridor roads was mined, and the ICRC was facilitating talks between Russian and Ukrainian forces.\n",
      "On 8 March, another attempt to evacuate civilians was made, but the Ukrainian government accused Russia of violating the ceasefire again by bombing the evacuation corridor.\n",
      "On 9 March, the Associated Press reported that scores of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers were being buried by city workers in a mass grave at one of the city's cemeteries. Russian shelling had hit the cemetery the previous day, interrupting the burials and damaging a wall. Later, another attempted ceasefire failed after Orlov reported that Russian soldiers had opened fire on construction workers and evacuation points. Orlov described the city's supply shortage as so severe that residents were melting snow to get water. Later that day, the Mariupol City Council issued a statement that a Russian airstrike had struck and destroyed a maternity ward and children's hospital. Ukrainian officials stated that three civilians were killed and at least 17 wounded.\n",

      "On 13 March, Boychenko stated that Russian forces had bombed the city at least 22 times in the previous 24 hours, with a hundred bombs, and added that the last food and water reserves in the city were being depleted. The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs said that the National Guard of Ukraine had damaged several Russian armored vehicles with artillery strikes during the day. İsmail Hacıoğlu, the head of the local Sultan Suleiman Mosque, stated that 86 Turkish citizens in the city were awaiting evacuation by the Turkish government.\n",
      "More than 160 cars were able to leave the city on 14 March at 13:00 local time, the first evacuation allowed during the siege. The Russian Ministry of Defense stated that 450 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been brought to the city after Russian forces captured the outskirts. Ukrainian military officials were later said to have killed 150 Russian soldiers and destroyed 10 Russian vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the same day, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, stated that Chechen soldiers were participating in the siege and had briefly entered Mariupol before retreating. Kadyrov also stated that Adam Delimkhanov, a close ally and member of the State Duma, was the commander of Chechen forces in Mariupol. The funeral for Captain Alexey Glushchak of the GRU was held in Tyumen, and it was revealed he died near Mariupol, likely in the early stages of the siege.\n",
      "On 15 March, around 4,000 vehicles with about 20,000 civilians were able to leave the city.\n",
      "Ukrainian government official Anton Herashchenko said that Russian Major General Oleg Mityaev, commander of the 150th Motorized Rifle Division, was killed when Russian forces tried to storm the city. The Donetsk Regional Drama Theatre, sheltering hundreds of civilians, was hit by a Russian airstrike on 16 March and destroyed. Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk Oblast, later stated that Russian forces had also targeted the Neptune swimming pool.\n",
      "On 18 March, DPR forces said they had captured the Mariupol airport from Ukrainian forces. Clashes later reached the city center, according to the mayor and on 19 March, Russian and Ukrainian forces began fighting at the Azovstal steel plant. On the same day, President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Colonel Volodymyr Baranyuk and Major Denys Prokopenko, leaders of the defense in Mariupol, the honor of Hero of Ukraine, the country's highest military award. During this time, while attempting to transport the killed and wounded to the hospital at Azovstal, Major Mykyta Nadtochii, commander of the Azov Regiment's second battalion, was wounded in a Russian airstrike.\n",
      "\n",
      "On 20 March, the city council of Mariupol claimed Russian forces had forcefully deported \"several thousand\" people to camps and remote cities in Russia over the past week. Russia denied the accusation. The same day, an art school building, which had sheltered some 400 people, was destroyed in a Russian bombing. No information on casualties was immediately available.\n",
      "An order by Russia's Ministry of Defence to surrender, lay down arms and evacuate the city was submitted on 20 March, requesting a written response by 02:00 UTC the next day. The ultimatum was rejected by the Ukrainian government and the mayor of Mariupol. By this point, one of the Ukrainian battalion commanders in the city described \"bombs falling every 10 minutes\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On 21 March, the first helicopter evacuation from Azovstal took place as eight or nine seriously wounded soldiers were evacuated, including the wounded Major Nadtochii. Two Ukrainian Mil Mi-8 helicopters flew into Azovstal as part of \"Operation Air Corridor\", carrying a special forces team with crates of Stinger and Javelin missiles, as well as a satellite internet system. \"Operation Air Corridor\" lasted until 7 April, when one helicopter was shot down, followed by the shooting down of a second helicopter that was sent as part of rescue efforts to search for survivors of the first downing. The four special forces members on board the second helicopter were killed, along with the helicopter's crew. Ukraine claimed 85 seriously wounded soldiers were evacuated as part of \"Operation Air Corridor\" during seven missions to the Azovstal plant to resupply or deliver reinforcements using some 16 Mi-8s, in pairs or fours, two of which were shot down, along with the rescue helicopter, according to Major General Kyrylo Budanov. In contrast, Ukrainian president Zelensky stated 90 percent of helicopter pilots sent to Mariupol during the course of the siege to resupply Ukrainian forces and evacuate the wounded were lost due to Russian air-defenses. According to Russia, one Ukrainian Mil Mi-8 helicopter was shot down on 28 March, as it was heading to Mariupol to evacuate the leaders of the Azov Regiment. In addition, Russia reported its forces shot down two more Ukrainian Mi-8s on 5 April, as they were once again attempting to evacuate Azov commanders. The Times later reported, after interviewing Ukrainian participants, that from 21 March to 11 May, 15 helicopters and 45 aircrew made nearly 30 attempted rescue missions delivering ammunition, equipment, medicine and evacuating wounded, with 6 flights being successful and 3 helicopters shot down with 23 killed in one crash.\n",
      "On 23 March, local authorities, including the mayor, left the city due to the deteriorating situation. The following day, Russian forces entered central Mariupol, seizing the Orthodox Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God. The city administration alleged that Russians were trying to demoralize residents by publicly shouting claims of Russian victories, including statements that Odesa had been captured.\n",
      "Vadym Boychenko said on 27 March that while Mariupol was still under Ukrainian control, Russian forces had entered deep into the city and that the city's population needed a \"complete evacuation\". By this point, Ukrainian soldiers had run out of food and clean drinking water, and an analyst believed that Ukrainian forces would not be able to fight on beyond a few days. However, Ukrainian officers refused to evacuate from the city, as they did not want to abandon their wounded and dead soldiers and civilians. The \"Club 8bit\" computer museum was destroyed.\n",
      "On 28 March, Mayor Vadym Boychenko said \"we are in the hands of the occupiers today\" in a televised interview, and a spokesman for the Mariupol mayor's office announced that \"nearly 5,000 people\" had been killed in the city since the start of the siege. The Ukrainian government estimated that \"from 20,000 to 30,000\" Mariupol residents had been forcibly sent to camps in Russia under Russian military control. During the day, Russian forces seized the administrative building in the northern Kalmiuskyi District and the military headquarters of the Azov Regiment. The next day, Russian forces were reported to have likely divided Ukrainian troops in the city into two and possibly even three pockets.\n",
      "On 2 April, Russian forces captured the SBU building in central Mariupol, after which there was no more reported fighting in the area. On 4 April, one Ukrainian battalion surrendered, with Russian officials stating two days later they captured 267 Ukrainian marines from the 503rd Battalion of the Ukrainian Naval Forces. Due to the surrender, the lines between the Ukrainian 36th Separate Marine Brigade and the Azov Regiment had been broken. On 7 April, the DPR announced central Mariupol had been cleared of Ukrainian forces.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Russian troops started an advance from the southwest on 1 April, leaving the Ukrainian military in partial control of the area around the port in the southwest of Mariupol by 7 April. On 4 April, a Russian Navy missile hit a Malta-based Dominica-flagged cargo ship, resulting in the ship catching fire. In addition, on 7 April, Russian forces captured a bridge leading to the Azovstal steel plant. The following day, Russian troops seized the southern part of Mariupol's port.\n",
      "On 10 April, Russian forces captured the fishing port, separating Ukrainian troops in the port from those in the Azovstal steel plant into two pockets, while a possible third pocket was centered on the Illich steel plant to the north. The next day, DPR forces claimed to have captured 80% of Mariupol. Local Ukrainian forces expected the city to fall soon, since they were running out of ammunition, and analysts at the Institute for the Study of War believed that Mariupol would fall within a week.\n",

      "On 11 April, Russian media reported that 160 Ukrainian servicemen from the 36th Separate Marine Brigade were captured with their equipment.\n",
      "During the night between 11 and 12 April, Baranyuk led the 36th Separate Marine Brigade in an attempt to break out of the Russian encirclement at the Illich steel plant to the north. After being spotted they broke into smaller groups, with some of them managing to link up with fighters of the Azov Regiment at the Azovstal plant to the southeast. A large number of Ukrainian servicemen were either killed or captured during the breakout. The fate of Baranyuk initially remained unknown. Later, the DPR claimed that they had identified the body of Baranyuk after their special forces blocked the Ukrainian breakout. However, on 8 May, Baranyuk appeared alive in an interview with RT, along with the 36th Brigade's Chief of Staff Dmytro Kormiankov. They were reported to have been captured during the breakout attempt.\n",
      "Around the same time at 11 April, a 16-man detachment from a battalion of tankers of the 17th Tank Brigade, which were doing operations supporting the 36th Brigade, did not follow Baranyuk's plan and instead broke through the siege. They used two tanks, anti-aircraft guns and cars for transport, and after breaking out they proceeded on foot for 175 km until reaching friendly Ukrainian positions. For leading his men to safety, the unit's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Grudzevych, was awarded a Hero of Ukraine medal.\n",
      "On 12 April, Aiden Aslin, a British man fighting with the Ukrainian Marines, reported that his unit was going to surrender since they had run out of ammunition, food and other supplies. Subsequently, in the evening, Russia stated that 1,026 Marines of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade had surrendered at the Illich steel plant, including 162 officers and 400 wounded fighters. Later, Russia said it captured an additional 134 Ukrainian servicemen, bringing the total number of prisoners to 1,160. Ukraine confirmed nearly 1,000 Marines had been captured, including wounded and those who remained at the Illich plant. On 13 April, Russian forces secured the Illich plant, reducing the number of pockets in Mariupol to two, while Russia also announced it had taken full control of Mariupol's commercial port, which was confirmed three days later. The commander of the Azov Regiment, Prokopenko, criticized the servicemen that had surrendered, while praising those that managed to link up with his unit. Prokopenko, as well as Ukrainian intelligence officer Illia Samoilenko, also blamed Baranyuk for the large losses inflicted on Ukrainian forces, stating his actions were uncoordinated. According to Prokopenko, Baranyuk's breakout attempt was made without warning to other units and the direction of attack was not previously agreed upon, while Samoilenko called Baranyuk a \"coward\", stating he tried to flee the city, \"taking with him people, tanks and ammunition\".\n",
      "Ukrainian military expert Oleg Zhdanov claimed that by this point the Russian 810th Guards Naval Infantry Brigade, originally sent from Feodosia, had suffered extremely heavy losses during the siege, to the extent of being \"destroyed twice.\"\n",

He also said that \"the situation is critical and the fighting is fierce\" but that sending reinforcements and breaking the siege \"can be done and it must be done as soon as possible\". On the same day, Ukrainian Defence Ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzianyk reported Russia started using Tu-22M3 long-range bombers to strike targets in Mariupol. The Azovstal iron and steel works, the heart of one of the remaining pockets of resistance, was well-defended and described as a \"fortress within a city\", as the steel plant was an enormous complex that made locating the Ukrainian forces difficult and had workshops that were difficult to destroy from the air. Additionally, the complex contained a system of underground tunnels, which would make clearing the entire complex challenging. During the day, Russian forces captured the base of the Ukrainian National Guard's 12th Operational Brigade, in western Mariupol.\n",
      "On 16 April, DPR troops seized a police station near Mariupol's beach and Russian forces were confirmed to have seized the Vessel Traffic Control Center at the port. Several days after the port was captured, on 20 April, a Ukrainian Marine officer claimed Marine and Azov forces from the Azovstal plant conducted an evacuation operation of around 500 members of the Ukrainian Border Guard and National Police from the port, as they were running out of ammunition. According to the officer, the Ukrainian forces from the Azovstal pocket made an armoured breakthrough to the port and provided covering fire, as the 500 besieged soldiers retreated to the Azovstal plant. Subsequently, Russia announced all urban areas of the city had been cleared, claiming that Ukrainian forces only remained at the Azovstal Steel Plant. However, fighting was reported to be continuing near Flotskaya street in the western Primorsky District.\n",
      "On 18 April, it was estimated that 95% of the city had been destroyed in the fighting. Ukrainian soldiers ignored a Russian ultimatum to surrender, deciding to fight to the end. Russia threatened to \"destroy\" those who continued to fight on. A military expert estimated that there could still be 500 to 800 Ukrainian soldiers holding out within the city, while Russian officials estimated that 2,500 Ukrainian soldiers and 400 foreign volunteers were holding out within the Azovstal plant.\n",

      "On 20 April, Russian and DPR forces made small advances on the outskirts of the Azovstal plant. That same day, Ukraine accused Russia of bombing a hospital sheltering 300 people. Serhiy Taruta, the former governor of the Donetsk region and a Mariupol native, said 300 people, including wounded troops and civilians with children, were sheltered at the hospital. On 21 April, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops not to storm the Azovstal steel plant, but to blockade it instead until the Ukrainian forces there ran out of supplies. He also reported that \"The completion of combat work to liberate Mariupol is a success\", while a Ukrainian official rebutted Putin's comments, saying that Russia's choice of implementing a blockade over storming the steel plant meant that Russia had admitted their inability to physically capture Mariupol. General Sir Richard Barrons, former commander of the United Kingdom's Joint Forces Command, assessed that the battle for the plant was no longer \"really relevant\" in regard to the control of the city and its roads, since Russia and Crimea were now connected. In his opinion, defeating Ukrainian forces at the plant would have been \"really difficult\" for Russian troops without an \"enormous cost to both sides\". Despite the ordered blockade, Russian forces advanced within 20 metres (66 ft) of some of the Ukrainian positions.\n",
      "On 22 April, the western Primorsky District was thought to be cleared by Russian forces, with no more reports of fighting, with all of the remaining Ukrainian forces surrounded in the Azovstal Steel Plant. Hundreds of civilians had also taken refuge at the plant. On 23 April, according to Ukraine, airstrikes and an apparent ground assault recommenced on the Azovstal steel works. An advisor to the Ukrainian President said: \"The enemy is trying to strangle the final resistance of the defenders of Mariupol in the Azovstal area\". However, this could not be independently confirmed. Ukrainian security chief Oleksiy Danilov claimed that at night, a helicopter had resupplied Azovstal. On the same day, it was reported that Russia was redeploying forces from Mariupol to other fronts in eastern Ukraine, with Russia reportedly redeploying 12 units from Mariupol. On the next day, Russian forces continued bombing Ukrainian positions in the Azovstal Steel Plant, with reports that Russian forces might have been planning a renewed assault on the facility. Meanwhile, Ukrainian supplies of ammunition were dwindling, while food and water were running dangerously low. During the night of 27 to 28 April, the heaviest airstrikes yet were reportedly conducted against Azovstal, with more than 50 strikes by Tu-22M3, Su-25s and Su-24s aircraft hitting the facility, according to Ukraine. Ukraine claimed a military field hospital was hit, with the number of wounded increasing from 170 before the strike to more than 600 after the bombing.\n",

This corridor was made after a trip by Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres to Moscow the previous week, where he personally brokered a deal. On 30 April, 20 civilians had left the Azovstal steel plant, while Russian media claimed a number of 25. Talks were underway to try and release the remaining 1,000 or so civilians. At least two of the wives of members of the Azov Regiment called for a concurrent evacuation of the about 2,000 forces that would be left behind after the civilian evacuation, highlighting concerns of treatment as POWs by the Russians and lack of medical and food supplies.\n",

Russian ground forces were also reported to be pulling out of the city, possibly to reinforce their positions elsewhere in the Donbas, where Russia was carrying out a large-scale offensive. According to one US DOD official: \"Largely the efforts around Mariupol for the Russians are now in the realm of airstrikes\". On 3 May, the Russian forces in Mariupol restarted their attacks on Azovstal. They began an assault on the steel plant in what have been called \"difficult bloody battles\". The following day it was reported the Russians had broken into the plant. Ukrainian politician Davyd Arakhamia said: \"Attempts to storm the plant continue for the second day. Russian troops are already on the territory of Azovstal.\" On 5 May, some 300 civilians were allowed to leave due to Russia opening humanitarian corridors. These corridors ran from 8am to 6pm. Ukrainian forces blamed Russian success on an electrician who gave Russian forces information about the underground tunnel network, claiming: “Yesterday, the Russians started storming these tunnels, using the information they received from the betrayer.”\n",
      "On 5 May, The Telegraph reported that Russia had intensified its bombing of the steel factory bunkers by using thermobaric bombs to increase the devastation of deployed firepower against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers who had lost all contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy had authorized the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.\n",

      "On 9 May, the Donetsk People's Republic held a Victory Day parade in Mariupol. The leader of the Republic, Denis Pushilin participated in the event. At the same time, a meeting took place near Mariupol involving Russian military representatives and Ukrainian commanders from Azovstal, including Major Prokopenko, who were brought to the meeting place by Russian armoured vehicles from Azovstal. During the meeting, the terms of the Ukrainians' surrender were agreed upon.\n",

The military said that 264 service members, 53 of them seriously wounded, had been taken by bus to areas controlled by Russian forces. A social media post was released by Azov Regiment commander Denys Prokopenko stating: \"In order to save lives, the entire Mariupol garrison is implementing the approved decision of the Supreme Military Command and hopes for the support of the Ukrainian people.\" Wounded Ukrainian soldiers from the Azovstal plant were taken to the DPR-controlled town of Novoazovsk for treatment. The evacuation of wounded troops was followed in the subsequent days by the surrender of the remainder of the garrison. Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said: \"Thanks to the defenders of Mariupol, Ukraine gained critically important time to form reserves and regroup forces and receive help from partners. And they fulfilled all their tasks. But it is impossible to unblock Azovstal by military means.\"\n",

Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the Azov Regiment. The ICRC registered the surrendered troops as prisoners of war at the request of both sides, collecting information to contact their families.\n",
      "On 18 May, Russian artillery and aircraft bombed once again Azovstal's remaining defenders. The DPR leadership claimed that the local high-ranking Ukrainian commanders had not yet surrendered. According to Russian sources, the last defenders surrendered on 20 May, among them Lieutenant Colonel Prokopenko, Major Volynskyi and Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, deputy commander of the Azov Regiment.

The Russian Defense Ministry denied attacking the building and accused the Azov Regiment of blowing it up.\n",
      "The bomb shelter in the basement, where people had been sheltering, however, was able to resist the attack according to Taruta. Survivors began emerging from the remains of the theatre on 17 March. More than 130 civilians had been rescued from the basement as of 18 March, according to Ukrainian officials, and rescuers had yet to find any fatalities. The city council stated that no one had died according to initial information, but one person was gravely wounded.\n",
      "The Associated Press reported that 600 civilians were killed during the airstrike, double the official number given by the Ukrainian government.\n",

      "=== Mass shelling of residential areas ===\n",
      "\n",
      "On 2 March, deputy mayor Sergiy Orlov reported that Russian artillery targeted a densely populated neighborhood of Mariupol, shelling it for nearly 15 hours. He said that one populated residential district on the city's left bank had been \"nearly totally destroyed\".\n",
      "Satellite photos of Mariupol taken the morning of 9 March taken by Maxar Technologies showed \"extensive damage\" to high-rise apartments, residential homes, grocery stores and other civilian infrastructure. This was determined by comparing before and after photos. The Mariupol council made a statement that the damage to the city has been \"enormous\". It estimated that approximately 80% of the city's homes had been significantly damaged, of which almost 30% were beyond repair. Reporting from Mariupol, Reuters reporter Pavel Klimov said that \"all around are the blackened shells\" of tower block dwellings.\n",
      "On 16 March, BBC News reported that nearly constant Russian attacks had turned residential neighbourhoods into \"a wasteland.\" On the same day it reported that it had obtained drone footage showing \"a vast extent of damage, with fire and smoke billowing out of apartment blocks and blackened streets in ruins.\" A city resident told the BBC that \"in the left bank area, there's no residential building intact, it's all burned to the ground.\" The left bank contained a densely populated residential district. She also said that the city centre is \"unrecognisable.\" On the same day the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that Russian forces continued to commit war crimes in Mariupol including \"targeting civilian infrastructure.\"\n",
      "On 18 March, Lieutenant General Jim Hockenhull, Chief of Defence Intelligence for the United Kingdom (UK), described \"continued targeting of civilians in Mariupol\". Ukrainian authorities stated that about 90% of buildings in Mariupol were now damaged or destroyed. On the same day, Sky News from the UK described videos as showing \"civilian areas left unrecognisable by the bombing.\" Sky News also quoted the Red Cross as describing \"Apocalyptic destruction in Mariupol.\" On 19 March 2022, a Ukrainian police officer in Mariupol made a video in which he said \"Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth.\" The video was authenticated by the Associated Press.\n",
      "The government of Mariupol said on 28 March that 90% of all buildings in Mariupol had been damaged by shelling, with 40% of all structures inside the city destroyed. The statistics released also counted that 90% of Mariupol's hospitals had been damaged, and that 23 schools and 28 kindergartens had been destroyed by Russian shelling.\n",
      "By 18 April, Ukrainian officials estimated that at least 95% of Mariupol had been destroyed in the fighting, largely as a result of the Russian bombing campaigns.\n",
      "On 12 April, city officials reported that up to 20,000 civilians had been killed. On the same day, the Mayor of the city reported that about 21,000 civilians had been killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Alleged use of chemical weapons ===\n",
      "On 11 April 2022, Eduard Basurin, a spokesperson for the Donetsk People's Republic, called for Russia to bring \"chemical forces\" to \"smoke out the moles\", referring to the Ukrainian forces in the Azovstal. Later on the same day, the Azov Regiment accused Russian forces of using \"a poisonous substance of unknown origin\" in Mariupol, causing respiratory problems. A Pentagon spokesperson said the reports were not confirmed, but they reflect concerns about Russia's potential use of chemical agents. Later, Ukraine stated that it was investigating the allegations. Three Ukrainian soldiers were injured in the incident.\n",
      "As of 2022, according to experts, it was too soon to say what exactly had happened, UK and Ukrainian officials said that they suspected the use of white phosphorus, which is not typically regarded as a chemical weapon in international law.\n",

      "== Media coverage ==\n",
      "Associated Press staff member Mstyslav Chernov and freelancer Evgeniy Maloletka, working for AP, stayed in Mariupol from late February until 11 March. They were among the few journalists, and, according to the AP, the only international journalists in Mariupol during that period, and their photographs were extensively used by Western media to cover the siege and the situation in the city. According to Chernov, on 11 March, they were in a hospital taking photos, when they were evacuated from the city with the assistance of Ukrainian soldiers. They managed to escape from Mariupol unharmed, at which point, he said, no journalists were left in the city.\n",
      "Testimonies from the Azovstal steel plant were made available via the Starlink satellite connections system. Thousands of Ukrainian troops cut off in Mariupol were able to use Starlink to send and publish online photos and videos to the outside world, before they had to surrender in May.\n",
      "Reporting in the state-controlled media in Russia presented the invasion as a liberation mission and accused Ukrainian troops of attacking civilian targets in Mariupol. In March 2023, during a visit to the city by president Putin, Marat Khusnullin assured that Russian forces did not use artillery fire against residential buildings during their advance on Mariupol, while accusing Ukrainian forces of destruction during their retreat. Previously, a number of videos from during the siege, showed Russian tanks firing at residential buildings. On the same day as Putin talked to Khusnullin, Russian Izvestya published an interview with a commander of a Russian 2S4 \"Tyulpan\" mortar battery who described that their mortars were so powerful that they were able to collapse nine-story multi-apartment blocks specifically during the siege of Mariupol.\n",
      "The Guardian observed in a piece on Mariupol published after the Russian attack on the Mariupol maternity ward that \"Entire settlements reduced to rubble, attacks on civilian targets and the bombing of refugee exit routes were all part of Moscow's brutal Syria campaign\", while the Washington Post under the headline \"Russia's Ukraine war builds on tactics it used in Syria, experts say\" related the effects on the civilian population as \"dwindling food supplies. No electricity or water. Russian tanks roaming the streets. Nights punctuated by shelling.\" Ukrainian officials warned that this battle risked \"becoming a second Aleppo.\" The Syria Civil Defense team said \"They want to empty those cities of their population, so it will be less costly for Russia to take over,\" and indeed some estimates were that 75% of Mariupol's population had left by 31 March.\n",

      "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War\n",
      "\n",
      "International sanctions have been imposed against Russia and Crimea during the Russo-Ukrainian War by a large number of countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union, and international organisations following the Russian annexation of Crimea, which began in late February 2014. Belarus has also been sanctioned for its cooperation with and assistance to Russian armed forces. The sanctions were imposed against individuals, businesses, and officials from Russia and Ukraine. Russia responded with sanctions against several countries, including a total ban on food imports from Australia, Canada, Norway, Japan, the United States, the EU and the United Kingdom.\n",
      "The sanctions contributed to the collapse of the Russian ruble and worsened the economic impact of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. They also caused economic damage to the EU economy, with total losses estimated at €100 billion (as of 2015). As of 2014, Russia's finance minister announced that the sanctions had cost Russia $40 billion, with another $100 billion loss in 2014 due to decrease in the price of oil the same year. Following sanctions imposed in August 2018, economic losses incurred by Russia amounted to around 0.5–1.5% in foregone GDP growth.\n",
      "As of June 2023, sanctions by the European Union and United States continue to be in effect. In January 2022, the EU announced the latest extension of sanctions until 31 July 2022. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, the EU, and other countries introduced or significantly expanded sanctions to include Vladimir Putin and other government officials. They also cut off selected Russian banks from SWIFT. The 2022 boycott of Russia and Belarus triggered the 2022 Russian financial crisis.\n",

      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the eruption of the Crimean crisis and the War in Donbass, tensions already existed between Russia and the United States over human rights issues. In December 2012, the US enacted the Magnitsky Act, intended to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Russian tax accountant Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow prison in 2009 by prohibiting their entry to the US and use of its banking system. 18 individuals were originally affected by the Act. In December 2016, Congress enacted the Global Magnitsky Act to allow the US Government to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world. On 21 December 2017, 13 additional names were added to the list of sanctioned individuals, not just Russians. Other countries passed similar laws to ban foreigners deemed guilty of human rights abuses from entering their countries.\n",
      "In response to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, some governments and international organisations, led by the United States and European Union, imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses. As the unrest expanded into other parts of Eastern Ukraine, and later escalated into the ongoing war in the Donbass region, the scope of the sanctions increased.\n",
      "Overall, three types of sanctions were imposed: ban on provision of technology for oil and gas exploration, ban on provision of credits to Russian oil companies and state banks, travel restrictions on the influential Russian citizens close to President Putin and involved in the annexation of Crimea. The Russian government responded in kind, with sanctions against some Canadian and American individuals and, in August 2014, with a total ban on food imports from the European Union, United States, Norway, Canada and Australia.\n",
      "As of December 2023, the Russian nuclear industry remained exempt from sanctions and the national nuclear company Rosatom remained the largest actor in the international market for nuclear reactor construction (also playing key roles in nuclear fuel supplies, nuclear equipment supplies, and handling nuclear waste).\n",
      "On 23 February 2024, the U.S. imposed trade restrictions on 93 entities for their assistance to Russia's war effort in Ukraine, including 63 from Russia, 16 from Turkey, 8 from China and 4 from the UАЕ. The UАЕ-based Crynofist Aviation was also targeted, which provides spare parts for airplanes. Additionally, the U.S. imposed more than 500 sanctions on Moscow and its accomplices for funding the war and for the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian individuals, companies and officials ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanctioned individuals include notable and high-level central government personnel and businessmen on all sides. In addition, companies suggested for possible involvement in the controversial issues have also been sanctioned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== First round: March/April 2014 ===\n",
      "On 6 March 2014, U.S. president Barack Obama, invoking, inter alia, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act, signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and ordering sanctions, including travel bans and the freezing of U.S. assets, against not-yet-specified individuals who had \"asserted governmental authority in the Crimean region without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine\" and whose actions were found, inter alia, to \"undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine\".\n",
      "On 17 March 2014, the United States, the European Union, and Canada introduced specifically targeted sanctions, the day after the disputed Crimean referendum and a few hours before Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing Crimea as an independent state, laying the groundwork for its annexation of Crimea by Russia. The principal EU sanction aimed to \"prevent the entry into ... their territories of the natural persons responsible for actions which undermine ... the territorial integrity ... of Ukraine, and of natural persons associated with them, as listed in the Annex\". The EU imposed its sanctions \"in the absence of de-escalatory steps by the Russian Federation\" in order to bring an end to the violence in eastern Ukraine. The EU at the same time clarified that the union \"remains ready to reverse its decisions and reengage with Russia when it starts contributing actively and without ambiguities to finding a solution to the Ukrainian crisis\".\n",
      "These 17 March sanctions were the most wide-ranging sanctions used against Russia since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. Japan also announced sanctions against Russia, which included the suspension of talks regarding military matters, space, investment, and visa requirements. A few days later, the US government expanded the sanctions.\n",
      "On 19 March, Australia imposed sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea. These sanctions targeted financial dealings and travel bans on those who have been instrumental in the Russian threat to Ukraine's sovereignty. Australian sanctions were expanded on 21 May.\n",
      "In early April, Albania, Iceland and Montenegro, as well as Ukraine, imposed the same restrictions and travel bans as those of the EU on 17 March. Igor Lukšić, foreign minister of Montenegro, said that despite a \"centuries old-tradition\" of good ties with Russia, joining the EU in imposing sanctions had \"always been the only reasonable choice\". Slightly earlier in March, Moldova imposed the same sanctions against former president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and a number of former Ukrainian officials, as announced by the EU on 5 March.\n",
      "In response to the sanctions introduced by the United States and the European Union, the State Duma (Lower House of the Russian parliament) unanimously passed a resolution asking for all members of the Duma be included on the sanctions list. The sanctions were expanded to include prominent Russian businessmen and women a few days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Second round: April 2014 ===\n",
      "On 10 April, the Council of Europe suspended the voting rights of Russia's delegation.\n",
      "On 28 April, the United States imposed a ban on business transactions within its territory on seven Russian officials, including Igor Sechin, executive chairman of the Russian state oil company Rosneft, and 17 Russian companies.\n",
      "On the same day, the EU issued travel bans against a further 15 individuals. The EU also stated the aims of EU sanctions as:\n",
      "\n",
      "sanctions are not punitive, but designed to bring about a change in policy or activity by the target country, entities or individuals. Measures are therefore always targeted at such policies or activities, the means to conduct them and those responsible for them. At the same time, the EU makes every effort to minimise adverse consequences for the civilian population or for legitimate activities.\n",

      "=== Third round: 2014–2021 ===\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== 2014 ====\n",
      "In response to the escalating War in Donbass, on 17 July 2014 the United States extended its transactions ban to two major Russian energy firms, Rosneft and Novatek, and to two banks, Gazprombank and Vnesheconombank. United States also urged EU leaders to join the third wave leading EU to start drafting European sanctions a day before. On 25 July, the EU officially expanded its sanctions to an additional 15 individuals and 18 entities, with an additional eight added on 30 July. On 31 July 2014 the EU introduced the third round of sanctions which included an embargo on arms and related material, and embargo on dual-use goods and technology intended for military use or a military end user, a ban on imports of arms and related material, controls on export of equipment for the oil industry, and a restriction on the issuance of and trade in certain bonds, equity or similar financial instruments on a maturity greater than 90 days (In September 2014 lowered to 30 days)\n",
      "On 24 July 2014, Canada targeted Russian arms, energy and financial entities. On 5 August 2014, Japan froze the assets of \"individuals and groups supporting the separation of Crimea from Ukraine\" and restrict imports from Crimea and froze funds for new projects in Russia in line with the policy of the EBRD. On 8 August 2014, Australia announced that Australia is \"working towards\" tougher sanctions against Russia.\n",
      "On 12 August 2014, Norway adopted the tougher sanctions against Russia that were imposed by the European Union and the United States on 12 August 2014. The Norwegian foreign minister Børge Brende said that it would also impose restrictions similar to the EU's 1 August sanctions. Russian state-owned banks will be banned from taking long-term and mid-term loans, arms exports will be banned and supplies of equipment, technology and assistance to the Russian oil sector will be prohibited.\n",
      "On 14 August 2014, Switzerland expanded sanctions against Russia over its threat to Ukraine's sovereignty. Swiss government added 26 more Russians and pro-Russian Ukrainians to the list. The Swiss government said it is expanding measures to prevent the circumvention of sanctions relating to the situation in Ukraine to include the third round of sanctions imposed by the EU in July and also stated that five Russian banks will require authorisation to issue long-term financial instruments in Switzerland. On 28 August 2014, Switzerland amended its sanctions to include the sanctions imposed by the EU in July.\n",
      "On 14 August 2014, Ukraine passed a law introducing Ukrainian sanctions against Russia. The law includes 172 individuals and 65 entities in Russia and other countries for supporting and financing \"terrorism\" in Ukraine, though actual sanctions would need approval from Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.\n",
      "On 11 September 2014, US president Obama said that the United States would join the EU in imposing tougher sanctions on Russia's financial, energy and defence sectors. On 12 September 2014, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia's largest bank (Sberbank), a major arms maker and arctic (Rostec), deepwater and shale exploration by its biggest oil companies (Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas and Rosneft). Sberbank and Rostec will have limited ability to access the US debt markets. The sanction on the oil companies seek to ban co-operation with Russian oil firms on energy technology and services by companies including Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc.\n",
      "On 24 September 2014, Japan banned the issue of securities by 5 Russian banks and also tightened restrictions on defence exports to Russia.\n",
      "On 3 October 2014, US vice president Joe Biden said that \"It was America's leadership and the president of the United States insisting, ofttimes almost having to embarrass Europe to stand up and take economic hits to impose costs\" and added that \"And the results have been massive capital flight from Russia, a virtual freeze on foreign direct investment, a ruble at an all-time low against the dollar, and the Russian economy teetering on the brink of recession. We don't want Russia to collapse. We want Russia to succeed. But Putin has to make a choice. These asymmetrical advances on another country cannot be tolerated. The international system will collapse if they are.\"\n",
      "On 18 December 2014, the EU banned some investments in Crimea, halting support for Russian Black Sea oil and gas exploration and stopping European companies from purchasing real estate or companies in Crimea, or offering tourism services. On 19 December 2014, US president Obama imposed sanctions on Russian-occupied Crimea by executive order prohibiting exports of US goods and services to the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Sanctions specific to Crimea ====\n",
      "The United States, Canada, the European Union, and other European countries (including Ukraine) imposed economic sanctions specifically targeting Crimea. Sanctions prohibit the sale, supply, transfer, or export of goods and technology in several sectors, including services directly related to tourism and infrastructure. They list seven ports where cruise ships cannot dock. Sanctions against Crimean individuals include travel bans and asset freezes. Visa and MasterCard have stopped service in Crimea between December 2014 and April 2015.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== 2015 – 2017 ====\n",
      "On 16 February 2015, the EU increased its sanction list to cover 151 individuals and 37 entities. Australia indicated that it would follow the EU in new sanctions.\n",
      "On 18 February 2015, Canada added 37 Russian citizens and 17 Russian entities to its sanction list. Rosneft and the deputy minister of defence, Anatoly Antonov, were both sanctioned. In June 2015 Canada added three individuals and 14 entities, including Gazprom. Media suggested the sanctions were delayed because Gazprom was a main sponsor of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup then concluding in Canada.\n",
      "In September 2015, Ukraine sanctioned more than 388 individuals, over 105 companies and other entities. In accordance with the August 2015 proposals promulgated by the Security Service of Ukraine and the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No. 808-p dated 12 August 2015, Ukraine, on 2 September 2015, declared Russia an enemy of Ukraine. Also on 16 September 2015, the Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko issued a decree that named nearly 400 individuals, more than 90 companies and other entities to be sanctioned for the Russia's \"criminal activities and aggression against Ukraine.\"\n",
      "In April 2016, Lithuania sanctioned 46 individuals who were involved in the detention and sentencing of Ukrainian citizens Nadiya Savchenko, Oleh Sentsov, and Olexandr Kolchenko. Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Linkevičius said that his country wanted to \"focus attention on the unacceptable and cynical violations of international law and human rights in Russia. [...] It would be more effective if the blacklist became Europe-wide. We hope to start such a discussion.\"\n",
      "On 29 December 2016, the US president Barack Obama signed an Executive Order that expelled 35 Russian diplomats, locked down two Russian diplomatic compounds, and expanded sanctions against Russia for its interference in the 2016 United States elections.\n",
      "In August 2017, the US Congress enacted the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that imposed new sanctions on Russia for interference in the 2016 elections and its involvement in Ukraine and Syria. The act converted the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders into law to prevent the president easing, suspending or ending of sanctions without the approval of Congress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== 2018 ====\n",
      "On 15 March 2018, Trump imposed financial sanctions under the act on the 13 Russian government hackers and front organizations that had been indicted by Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On 6 April 2018, the United States imposed economic sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they control, accusing them of \"malign activity around the globe\", along with 17 top Russian officials, the state-owned weapons-trading company Rosoboronexport and the Russian Financial Corporation Bank (RFC Bank). High-profile names on the list include Oleg Deripaska and Kiril Shamalov, Putin's ex-son-in-law, who married Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova in February 2013. The press release stated: \"Deripaska has been investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering. There are also unsubstantiated allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman in the 1990's, and had links to a Russian organized crime group.\"\n",
      "Other names on the list include: Oil tycoon Vladimir Bogdanov, Suleyman Kerimov, who faced money-laundering charges in France for allegedly bringing hundreds of millions of euros into the country without reporting the money to tax authorities, Igor Rotenberg, principal owner of Russian oil and gas drilling company Gazprom Burenie, Andrei Skoch, a deputy in the State Duma. U.S. officials said he has longstanding ties to Russian organized criminal groups, Viktor Vekselberg, founder and chairman of the Renova Group, asset management company, and Aleksandr Torshin.\n",
      "In August 2018, following the poisoning of Sergey Skripal, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed further sanctions on dual-use exports to Russia which were deemed to be sensitive on national security grounds, including gas turbine engines, integrated circuits, and calibration equipment used in avionics. Until that moment, such exports were considered on a case-by-case basis. Following the introduction of these sanctions, the default position is of denial. Also, on September that year a list of companies in the space and defense industry came under sanctions, including: AeroComposit, Divetechnoservices, Scientific-Research Institute \"Vektor\", Nilco Group, Obinsk Research and Production Enterprise, Aviadvigatel, Information Technology and Communication Systems (Infoteks), Scientific and Production Corporation of Precision Instruments Engineering and Voronezh Scientific Research Institute \"Vega\", whom are forbidden from doing business with.\n",

Also, the U.S. targeted persons involved in the 2018 Donbass general elections.\n",
      "On 2 August 2019, the U.S State Department announced additional sanctions together with an executive order signed by President Trump which gives the Department of Treasury and the Department of Commerce the authority to implement the sanctions. The sanctions forbid granting Russia loans or other assistance from international financial institutions, prohibition on U.S banks buy non-ruble denominated bonds issued by the Russia after 26 August and lending non-ruble denominated funds to Russia and licensing restrictions for exports of items for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      " In September 2019, pursuant to Executive Order 13685 Maritime Assistance LLC was placed under sanctions due to its export of fuel to Syria as well as for providing support to Sovfracht, another company sanctioned for operating in Crimea.

      "\n",
      "After Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, two countries that had not previously taken part in sanctions, namely South Korea and non-UN member state Taiwan, engaged in sanctions against Russia. On 28 February 2022, Singapore announced that it will impose banking sanctions against Russia for the invasion of Ukraine, thus making it the first country in Southeast Asia to impose sanctions upon Russia; the move was described by the South China Morning Post as being \"almost unprecedented\". The sanctions also included materials that could be used for weapons against Ukraine, as well as electronics, technology devices and other related equipment, which were listed in a detailed statement on 5 March.\n",
      "On 28 February 2022, the Central Bank of Russia was blocked from accessing more than $400 billion in foreign-exchange reserves held abroad and the EU imposed sanctions on several Russian oligarchs and politicians. Bjoern Seibert, head of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's Cabinet, was in charge of leading the EU's negotiations with the US on the sanction's implementation.\n",
      "Sergei Aleksashenko, the former Russian deputy finance minister, said: \"This is a kind of financial nuclear bomb that is falling on Russia.\" On 1 March 2022, the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said the total amount of Russian assets being frozen by sanctions amounted to $1 trillion.\n",

      "The foreign ministers of the Baltic states called for Russia to be cut off from SWIFT, the global messaging network for international payments. Concern was expressed in Europe because European lenders held most of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia and because China had developed an alternative to SWIFT called CIPS; a weaponisation of SWIFT would provide greater impetus to the development of CIPS which, in turn, could weaken SWIFT. Other leaders calling for Russia to be stopped from accessing SWIFT include Czech president Miloš Zeman, and UK prime minister Boris Johnson. On 26 February, the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and economy minister Robert Habeck made a joint statement backing targeted restrictions of Russia from SWIFT.

In August 2022, Russia's trade and industry minister Denis Manturov stated, \"we are not interested in the nationalization of enterprises or their removal.\" In October 2022, a government decree was approved, allowing a Russian state-run company to seize ExxonMobil's 30% stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, and to decide whether foreign shareholders, including Japan's SODECO, can retain their participation.\n",
      "Russia continued to pump almost as much oil as before its 2022 invasion of the Ukraine. Sales to the Middle East and Asia have replaced declining exports of gas and oil to Europe, and due to the higher price, Moscow made $20 billion monthly compared to $14.6 billion a year before (2021). Despite international sanctions, Russian energy sales increased in value, and its exports expanded with new financing options and payment methods for international buyers. According to the Institute of International Finance, \"Russia is swimming in cash\", earning $97 billion from oil and gas sales through July 2022. According to a former Russian energy executive, \"there came a realization that the world needs oil, and nobody's brave enough to embargo 7.5 million barrels a day of Russian oil and oil products\".\n",
      "According to the Former First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia Oleg Vyugin, sanctions imposed against Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine were only 30%-40% effective as Russia has found ways to overcome restrictions. He confirmed the contraction of the Russian economy by 4% in 2022 due to sanctions, but found this has been \"no catastrophe\" for the Russian Federation. Russia's current account surplus – the difference in value between exports and imports – has been soaring due to declining imports, but he warned that a further embargo on Russian exports could reduce crucial revenues. He also added that the impact of US and European export controls in the technology sector will be felt with some delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2022, when the European Union implemented its oil embargo and price cap on Russian crude, economic news channels reported a drop of Russian oil exports by 54% in the first week. Russia switched to sending nearly 90% of its oil to Asia, albeit at a lower price. Shipowners in Asia as well were reportedly less likely to transport Russian crude after the European sanctions came into force.\n",
      "In late 2022, the Russian economy's relative resilience to Western sanctions was tested when financial sanctions seriously impacted Russia's VTB Bank, the country's No. 2 lender. VTB bank has frozen assets abroad worth around 600 billion roubles, and then purchased Otkritie FC Bank to make up for the loss. The Bank of Russia agreed to the sale for 233 billion roubles in cash and treasury bonds, increasing the share-value for Moscow-listed VTB. Dominant lender Sberbank, however, was less affected by financial sanctions and produced a quarterly profit. The central bank announced a bail-out of 555 billion roubles, and with the recent sale of Otkritie obtained a refund of 352 billion roubles.\n",
      "According to Russian calculations, the country's economy shrank by 2.5% in 2022, showing better dynamics than expected by Western analysts. Both Russia's current trade account balance and foreign currency reserves increased significantly due to decreased imports from Western countries. Because of the increased expenditure for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Moscow posted a record budget deficit of US$47.3 billion in 2022 (2.3% of GDP) requiring a drawdown from the National Wealth Fund. Some of the reduction in trade with Western Europe was compensated by a record trade balance with China, US$190 billion in 2022. The Russian state as well as its citizens purchased a record amount of gold from Russian banks in 2022 (64 to 67 metric tons). Gold, which significantly increased in value in late 2022 and early 2023, is seen as another backbone of the Russian economy. Russia attempts to create a gold-backed stablecoin to support its foreign trade in light of ongoing sanctions.\n",

      "Two financial reports from late 2022 and early 2023 concluded that only 8.5% or less than one out of ten companies had divested at least one subsidiary in Russia. In comparison, between economic regions, 18% of US companies with subsidiaries exited Russia, some 15% of Japanese firms and only 8.3% of EU firms have done the same. Among EU nations, Italian companies were least likely to exit from Russia. Particularly firms involved in lucrative resource extraction and agriculture remain active there, but also pharmaceutical companies, which are exempt from sanctions. Quantitatively, those companies which left Russia (a total of 120) represent only 6.5% of total profits of all the firms active there. Even companies that planned a full withdrawal had struggled to pull out their businesses swiftly and comply with sanctions or NGO demands, according to business analysts.\n",
      "Year on year, Russian car production fell 67% from 2022 to 2023. Truck production decreased 24%  A particularly drastic fall occurred in May 2022 when car production dropped 97%, but rebounded after some adaptations. Car sales fell 63%\n",
      "In March 2023, renewed assessments on the Russian economy were made public. Former Russian Central Bank official Alexandra Prokopenko had warned that \"Russia's economy is entering a long-term regression\". Western economists also expressed that Russia's resilience was only short term, and that subsequent to the oil and gas embargo by Europe in late 2022 and early 2023, the RF would enter a recessive period. The IMF predicts that Russia's economic growth would be at only 1%, down from 3.5% before 2014, when it annexed the Crimea from Ukraine. Russia's federal budget deficit continued into 2023, requiring additional drawdowns from the National Wealth Fund, economists predicted a further isolation of the Russian economy. Meanwhile, later that month, Mr. Putin and Chinese PM Xi Jinping had met again also to further increase economic cooperation particularly in the area of high technology and energy. Despite Russia's present slow growth, it has increased its military output, as the production of finished metal goods increased by 7% in 2022 due to the conflict in the Ukraine.\n",
      "In early April 2023, Bloomberg News noted that Russia's seaborne crude oil exports had increased due to the sanctions on pipeline deliveries to Western Europe. According to ship-tracking data, the nation's shipments surged by 1 million barrels/d to a new high of 4.13 million barrels. Data also indicates that most sales were conducted below the price cap of $60/barrel, because Russia offered discounts on Urals oil or the price cap set by Western nations showed some effects to reduce Russia’s revenues.\n",
      "In mid 2023, new data showed that Russia's economic decline was well below the value analysts had predicted earlier. The fall-out for the Russian economy was already much less severe in 2022, namely 2.1% rather than the double digit numbers the West forecasted. Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank held its interest rate at 7.5% for June to allow more borrowing by the Russian economy that still experiences a significant inflation risk. China-Russia trade surged as well reaching $93.8 billion since January 2023, a 75.6% increase, to replace declining trade volumes with the countries imposing sanctions. Its economy is now predicted to only fall by 0.7%. The ruble continues its slow but steady decline.\n",
      "The Russian budget deficit for the five months to May was 3.41 trillion roubles ($41.9 billion) higher than the planned budget deficit for the whole year, with gas and oil revenues down 49% on 2022, spending was up 26% and non-oil-and-gas revenues were 9% higher.\n",
      "Some limitations on the effect of sanctions was seen in July 2023, when crude oil prices were again up with some Urals oil trading just above US$60 per barrel. The recent decline in oil revenue was due to lower prices in late 2022 and early 2023, with little sign that Russia's oil export volume actually decreased.\n",
      "In late December 2023, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Alexander Novak confirmed earlier reports that the country had shifted most if its sales of Russian crude to China and India while still supplying 4-5% of its total sales to European destinations. He also forecasted relatively high prices at around $80-85 (roughly €72-77) per barrel to continue well into 2024. In 2023 about 90% of Russian oil exports were delivered to the two largest Asian nations, which are totaling a revenue of almost 9 trillion rubles (roughly $98 billion), which is about 27% of its GDP. Russia had reported that 40-45% were due to exports to India, a market that is expected to grow most rapidly for its Asian-Pacific segment. Initially E.U. politicians had shrugged off this development, assuming net revenues for Russia were much lower due to steep discounts and lower prices on the global market, but as India had expanded its capabilities in oil refining and re-exporting particularly diesel fuel to Europe, this development had again been interpreted by Western nations as a problematic breach of international sanctions they impose to curtail Russia’s ambitions during the war in Ukraine. About 57% of Russia’s export revenues are based on sales of crude, and it aims to further expand that market to nations in Africa as well as South America in the coming years.\n",

The German business sector, with around 30,000 workplaces depending on trade with the Russian Federation, also reported being affected significantly by the sanctions. The sanctions affected numerous European market sectors, including energy, agriculture, and aviation among others. In March 2016, the Finnish farmers' union MTK stated that the Russian sanctions and falling prices have put farmers under tremendous pressure. Finland's Natural Resources Institute LUKE has estimated that in 2015, farmers saw their incomes shrink by at least 40 percent compared to the previous year.\n",

      "In 2017, the UN Special Rapporteur Idriss Jazairy published a report on the impact of sanctions, stating that the EU countries were losing about \"3.2 billion dollars a month\" due to them. He also noted that the sanctions were \"intended to serve as a deterrent to Russia but run the risk of being only a deterrent to the international business community, while adversely affecting only those vulnerable groups which have nothing to do with the crisis\" (especially people in Crimea, who \"should not be made to pay collectively for what is a complex political crisis over which they have no control\").\n",

      "==== 2022–present ====\n",
      "In May 2022, the EU decided to partially ban Russian oil imports, except those obtained through pipelines via Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic until the end of 2022. Crude oil prices again jumped as supplies for fossil fuels remained constrained; the decision by the European Council exacerbated worries about an already-tight energy market. Besides Hungary, which gained significant exemptions from the oil embargo, Italy was also initially an opponent of such sanctions. The EU oil embargo is now putting at risk one of Italy's largest refineries, located in Sicily's Province of Syracuse.\n",
      "The detrimental effects on European countries from economic sanctions against Russia had been initially valued as not significant compared to the impact these measures have on the Russian economy. However, after 2022, a number of economists have pointed out that Eastern European countries with more intense economic relations with Russia (and Ukraine) before the conflict, would experience more disruptions to their economies. These 'asymmetric effects' might be considerable, particularly for smaller countries with domestic production, as these international sanctions not only affected the energy industry but also agriculture and manufacturing, as well as the financial sector. After the onset of the armed conflict in 2022, energy prices had skyrocketed, contributing to the 2021/2022 energy crisis. While those energy prices in 2023 had fallen again and shortages, particularly for LNG had eased, other factors came into play, such as the serious disruption of grain exports through the Black Sea corridor, thus causing a glut of grain in Eastern Europe, depressing prices seriously and endangering the livelihood of local farmers in Poland, Hungary as well as Bulgaria.\n",
      "In contrast, economic sanctions against Russia's petrochemical industry have benefited the U.S. energy economy, while Europe was impacted negatively. Exports of American LNG to Europe have more than doubled since 2021. According to the International Energy Agency, US shipments of natural gas to Europe in June 2022 exceeded the amount Russia was supplying via pipelines. In late 2022, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck accused the US and other \"friendly\" gas supplier nations from profiting in the Ukraine war with \"astronomical prices\". He called for more solidarity by the US to assist energy-pressed allies, and to reverse the economic decline in Europe.\n",
      "According to the Financial Times, European companies had lost at least €200 billion in 2022 in Germany alone due to reduced profits from sanctions in the automobile, energy and chemical sectors. The German chemical sector by itself experienced a current decline of 25% in 2023, after a still smaller decline of 8.5% in 2022. \n",

      "Western countries have accused Russia to interfere with wheat exports from Ukraine due to armed confrontations in Odesa and other Ukrainian ports. Later the Kremlin pushed back and accused the West of imposing sanctions on the Russian economy that hinder the export of wheat from the Russian Federation. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov referred to Russia as \"a rather reliable grain exporter\". During a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, Putin confirmed Russia's willingness to make \"a significant contribution to overcoming the food crisis through the export of grain and fertilizer\" but mentioned Western sanctions as the caveat.\n",
      "The head of the African Union, Senegalese President Macky Sall, remarked that the side effects of the EU's decision to expel many Russian banks from SWIFT will hurt the ability of African countries to pay for imported food and fertilizers from Russia.

      "On 14 September 2022, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reiterated his concerns over a constrained fertilizer supply from Russia due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent economic sanctions. According to the source, UN diplomats held discussions to re-open the Togliatti-Odesa pipeline carrying ammonia. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had offered such a move in exchange for the release of prisoners of war held by Russia. But TASS news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who dismissed such an idea, as saying  \"are people and ammonia the same thing?\". The pipeline remained unused.\n",

      "==== Shifting to safe havens ====\n",
      "Under the sanctions imposed by the US and the European Union, Russian oligarchs began looking for safe havens financially. Many of them moved their wealth to countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which could not match the Western sanctions. Investigations spotted a number of superyachts moored in Dubai and the Maldives. Private jets owned by these oligarchs were also tracked flying back and forth from Moscow to Dubai and Israel. The Russian elites have been shifting funds worth hundreds of millions of dollars from sanctioning countries like the UK and Switzerland to countries that do not impose sanctions like the UAE. Russian oligarchs facing sanctions from the West were not just seeking to buy properties in the UAE, but for long-term residence. Analysts assessed that these billionaires could avail the service of the Emirates' \"golden visa\" program by investing at least $2.7 million in a local company or investment fund. The golden visa program could allow these oligarchs to live, work, and study in the UAE with full ownership of their business.\n",
      "The shifting to safe havens also involves large gold sales that are now conducted through the UAE first before reaching other destinations. Due to the flexibility of gold transactions, and the ability to re-issue gold certificates as well as gold bullions, it is practically impossible to control the flow of gold from sanctioned entities. Even when gold-rich countries, such as Switzerland had adhered to EU sanctions, and no longer import gold directly from Russia, the trade with such commodities among others, actually increased for 2022 and early 2023. Furthermore, both China and Russia had increased their gold reserves considerably, even before the onset of the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, driving up the gold price. As the gold trade became less transparent due to the sanctions imposed on Russia, economic effects of such transactions are now much more difficult to predict.\n",

      "Europe's ending dependence on Russian fossil fuels lead to a push for energy independence via renewables. For some countries, such as Austria, however, with less alternative energy resources, the exit from Russian gas supplies has been difficult. In 2022/23 Austria imported the same amounts of liquified gas as before the Russian invasion of the Ukraine. Hungary also continues to obtain the same amount of gas as before the onset of the war but due to the fact that direct transfers from Ukraine were halted in summer 2023, it will import Russian gas via the TurkStream pipeline after October 1, 2023.\n",
      "Secretary-general of the United Nations António Guterres stated that \"instead of hitting the brakes on the decarbonization of the global economy, now is the time to put the pedal to the metal towards a renewable energy future.\"\n",
      "Some political policy-makers in Europe have made decisions to replace Russian fossil fuel imports with other fossil fuels imports and small temporary increases in European coal energy production and to assist people with high fossil fuel prices.\n",
      "Economic sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian war have accelerated a temporary use of coal in energy production worldwide. Soaring natural gas prices have made coal more competitive in many markets, and some nations have resorted to coal as a substitute for potential energy rationing in winter 2022/23. With demand for coal increasing in Asia and Europe, global coal consumption is forecast to rise a minimal amount in 2022. Burning coal or petroleum products emits significantly higher amounts of carbon dioxide and air pollutants compared to natural gas. The return to coal fills the energy gap before transition to greener and more sustainable energy sources.\n",
      "Europe could see a drop in fossil fuel power generation of 20% in 2023 as a large boost has been given to finding and speeding up renewable energy sources and for some EU countries, continuing longer with nuclear power.

      "After a member of the German Bundestag was denied entry into Russia in May 2015, Russia released a blacklist to EU authorities of 89 politicians and officials from the EU who are not allowed entry into Russia under the present sanctions regime. Russia asked for the blacklist to not be made public. The list is said to include eight Swedes, as well as two MPs and two MEPs from the Netherlands. Finland's national broadcaster Yle published a leaked German version of the list.\n",
      "In response to this publication, British politician Malcolm Rifkind (whose name was included on the Russian list) commented: \"It shows we are making an impact because they wouldn't have reacted unless they felt very sore at what had happened. Once sanctions were extended, they've had a major impact on the Russian economy. This happened at a time when the oil price had collapsed and therefore a main source of revenue for the Russian Federation disappeared\". Another person on the list, Swedish MEP Gunnar Hökmark, remarked that he was proud to be on the list and said \"a regime that does this does it because it is afraid, and at heart it is weak\".\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 15, 2015, with regard to Russia's entry ban on European politicians, a spokesperson from the European Commission said,\"The list with 89 names has now been shared by the Russian authorities. We don't have any other information on legal basis, criteria and process of this decision. We consider this measure as totally arbitrary and unjustified, especially in the absence of any further clarification and transparency.\"\n",

      "On 29 June 2016, Russian president Vladimir Putin signed a decree that extended the embargo on the countries already sanctioned until 31 December 2017.\n",
      "According to a 2020 study, the Russian counter-sanctions did not just serve Russia's foreign policy goals, but also facilitated Russia's protectionist policy. As a result of counter-sanctions, combined with government support of domestic agricultural production, production of grain, chicken, pork, cheese and other agricultural products has increased. Russia's food imports fell from 35% in 2013 to only 20% in 2018. The prices on these products have also risen dramatically though. In Moscow, from September 2014 to September 2018, the average price of cheese increased by 23%, milk by 35.7%, vegetable oil by 65%.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Sri Lankan economic crisis is an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka that started in 2019. It is the country's worst economic crisis since its independence in 1948. It has led to unprecedented levels of inflation, near-depletion of foreign exchange reserves, shortages of medical supplies, and an increase in prices of basic commodities. The crisis is said to have begun due to multiple compounding factors like tax cuts, money creation, a nationwide policy to shift to organic or biological farming, the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. The subsequent economic hardships resulted in the 2022 Sri Lankan protests. Sri Lanka received a lifeline in the form of an Indian line of credit amounting to $4 billion. This substantial credit infusion served to cover the costs of importing essential goods and fuel. As a result, the foreign currency reserves of debt-ridden Sri Lanka experienced a notable improvement, reaching $2.69 billion.\n",
      "Sri Lanka had been earmarked for sovereign default, as the remaining foreign exchange reserves of US$1.9 billion as of March 2022 would not be sufficient to pay the country's foreign debt obligations for 2022, with $4 billion to be repaid. An International Sovereign Bond repayment of $1 billion was due to be paid by the government in July 2022. Bloomberg reported that Sri Lanka had a total of $8.6 billion in repayments due in 2022, including both local debt and foreign debt. In April 2022, the Sri Lankan government announced that it was defaulting, making it the first sovereign default in Sri Lankan history since its independence in 1948 and the first state in the Asia-Pacific region to enter sovereign default in the 21st century.\n",
      "In June 2022, then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in parliament that the economy had collapsed, leaving it unable to pay for essentials.\n",
      "In September 2022, a United Nations report said that the economic crisis is a result of officials' impunity for human rights abuses and economic crimes. According to the Sri Lankan finance ministry, the country's foreign reserves had grown by 23.5% from US$1.7 billion in September 2022 to US$2.1 billion in February 2023, representing a US$400 million increase. Sri Lanka teeters on the edge of financial insolvency and has halted repayments on its international debts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "\n",
      "According to W. A. Wijewardena, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the country was a long way into an economic crisis in 2015. The government that came into power in 2015 knew this and had been warned by the Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka about a number of risks. While the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 had presented a strong economic policy to address the situation, the coalition government could not get the policy pushed through Parliament, which would eventually result in further policy confusion in the coming months.\n",
      "The government did not adequately address the economic warnings and emerging dangers, consuming itself in other government related activities such as \"constitutional reforms\". Certain practices, including those used by the Ministry of Finance led by Ravi Karunanayake, were globally frowned upon. Election related economic decisions were pushed such as excessive distribution of freebies. The Institute of Policy Studies of Sri Lanka's 2014 State of the Economy Report highlighted hot money, worrying borrowing practices, temporary and superficial quick-fixes and monopoly of foreign direct investment flow into the hospitality sector.\n",
      "Further political turmoil in 2018 worsened the economic outlook. By that time the government had carried out several reforms under an IMF supported program towards fiscal monetary consolidation and had successfully controlled inflation. These reforms included an automatic fuel pricing formula which significantly reduced fiscal risks posed by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), raised the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 11 percent to 15 percent, and broadened the VAT base by removing exemptions. Many of the reforms were reversed by the new government after the 2019 elections.\n",
      "Under Maithripala Sirisena administration, the 2019 Central Bank Bill was drafted to make the Central Bank independent from political influence by banning the Treasury Secretary and any member of the Government from becoming members of the Monetary Board. Money printing was also to be banned under this bill, as it states: \"The Central Bank shall not purchase securities issued by the government, by any government-owned entity, or any other public entity in the primary market.\" Then Central Bank Governor, Indrajit Coomaraswamy, noted Balance of Payments issues, increased inflation, and asset bubbles as reasons for the ban. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Party opposed an independent Central Bank and discarded the bill as soon as they came to power.\n",
      "Many experts compared Lebanon's economic situation with that of Sri Lanka and had warned that Sri Lanka too was on the way to defaulting on its sovereign bonds. Both nations had similar issues, including deep economic crises occurring after their successive governments piled up unsustainable debts following the end of civil wars. To reduce the inflation and control the economy crisis in April 2022, Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe was appointed as the 17th Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to replace Ajith Nivard Cabraal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Causes ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Tax cuts and money creation ===\n",
      "The Government of Sri Lanka under president Gotabaya Rajapaksa made large tax cuts that affected government revenue and fiscal policies, causing budget deficits to soar. These cuts included increased tax-free thresholds that resulted in a 33.5% decline in registered taxpayers, reducing VAT to 8%, reducing corporate tax from 28% to 24%, the abolishment of the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax and the 2% “nation-building tax” which financed infrastructure development. The massive loss of tax revenue resulted in rating agencies downgrading the sovereign credit rating making it harder to take more debt. In 2021 P. B. Jayasundera stated that President Rajapaksa was aware of the loss of revenue but considered it an \"investment\" and had no plans of increasing taxes for another 5 years.\n",
      "To cover government spending, the Central Bank began printing money in record amounts ignoring advice from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to stop printing money and instead hike interest rates and raise taxes while cutting spending. The IMF warned that continuing to print money would lead to an economic implosion. The tax cuts were also opposed by the former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera who noted that as the Sri Lankan government already had far less tax revenue relative to most countries which combined with its high debt load tax cuts would be dangerous. Samaraweera predicted that \"If these proposals are implemented like this not only will the entire country go bankrupt, but the entire country will become another Venezuela or another Greece.\"\n",
      "On 6 April 2022, the CBSL allegedly printed 119.08 billion rupees, making it the highest reported amount printed on a single day by the CBSL for the year 2022. The total money added to financial markets for the year 2022 increased to Rs. 432.76 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== External debt ===\n",
      "Until mid-2000s, the Sri Lankan debt was mainly from multilateral lending agencies, after which it was reoriented under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa to foreign investors and lenders. Sri Lanka issued its first international sovereign bond in 2007, with high interest rates to incentivise investors. According to commentators, the money was used to fund vanity projects rather than projects of national utility.\n",
      "Sri Lanka's foreign debt increased substantially, going from US$11.3 billion in 2005 to $56.3 billion in 2020. While foreign debt was about 42% of the GDP in 2019, it rose to 119% of its GDP in 2021. By February 2022, the country had only $2.31 billion left in its reserves, yet faces debt repayments of around $4 billion in 2022, which also includes a $1 billion international sovereign bond (ISB) maturing in July.\n",
      "In 2020, US economist Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, published a report that blamed the quantitative easing policy made by US banks after 2008, for exporting debt bubbles to developing countries including Sri Lanka. In the same year, Chatham House published a report that concluded that Sri Lanka's debt crisis was primarily \"a result of domestic policy decisions and was facilitated by Western lending and monetary policy\". Their research pointed that after 2008, western central banks had favored a monetary policy of quantitative easing, which created low global interest rates, and had largely facilitated Rajapaksa's borrowing-and-spending spree as he borrowed low interest ISBs heavily. However the winding-down of quantitative easing in the US after 2013, had later sharply increased Sri Lanka's borrowing costs, and the interests rates doubled, to approximately 10 percent for short-term loans, while long-term rates had jumped from 7 to 8 percent to 11–13 percent. Failure to defend their currency, further shrank Sri Lanka's foreign reserves to only $6 billion by 2016.\n",
      "In 2020, S&P Global Ratings said Sri Lanka's existing funding sources did not appear sufficient to cover its debt servicing needs, estimated at just over $4.0 billion in 2021. According to the agency Bellwether, \"To solve Sri Lanka's 'budgetary problem' in repaying debt, Treasuries auctions have to succeed. When that is done, the 'transfer problem' of foreign exchange will be automatically solved... Instead, with failed Treasury bill auctions filled with printed money, the country is slipping deeper into debt.\"\n",
      "To resolve the debt crisis, Bellwether noted that Sri Lanka would need a credible fiscal plan and monetary policy, increasing taxes to repay debt, and interest rates and opening of imports would allow taxes to flow back to the Treasury. While it is possible to raise rates and generate dollars to repay the foreign debt by curtailing domestic credit, it is not practical to do so on an ongoing basis for many years. If investors see foreign reserves going up after debt repayments, confidence may come back but it is an arduous affair, which may or may not work given the current ideology.\n",
      "In September 2021, the government announced an economic emergency, as the situation was further aggravated by the falling national currency exchange rate, inflation rising as result of high food prices, and pandemic restrictions in tourism which further decreased the country's income. This drove Sri Lanka to the brink of bankruptcy due to foreign reserves falling to $1.9 billion as of March 2022, this being insufficient to pay the foreign debt obligations of $4 billion and an International Sovereign Bond (ISB) payment of $1 billion for the year 2022. The national inflation rate increased to 17.5% in February 2022, according to the National Consumer Price Index.\n",
      "The government repaid $500 million International Sovereign Bonds which was due in January 2022 despite growing opposition coming from economic analysts and experts who all advised the government to postpone the ISB payment in order to preserve the foreign reserves.\n",
      "On 12 April 2022, Sri Lanka announced that it will be defaulting on its external debt of $51 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Debt trap ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerous observers have described the loans made to Sri Lanka by the Exim Bank of China to build the Hambantota International Port and the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, which turned out to be unprofitable white elephants, as examples of debt-trap diplomacy and predatory lending. China is Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender.\n",
      "In 2007, the state-owned Chinese firms China Harbour Engineering Company and Sinohydro Corporation were hired to build the port for $361 million. Exim funded 85 percent of the project at an annual interest rate of 6.3 percent. After the project began losing money and Sri Lanka's debt-servicing burden increased, its government decided to lease the project to state-owned China Merchants Port on a 99-year lease for cash. The $1.12 billion lease to the Chinese company was used by Sri Lanka to address balance-of-payment issues.\n",
      "Debt-trap diplomacy is considered \"a severe concern to developing countries like Sri Lanka\" by the Institute for Security and Development Policy. Both the U.S. Trump and Biden administrations described the occurrence of Chinese debt-trap diplomacy, especially in the case of Sri Lanka.\n",
      "Former Sri Lankan prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa defended the country's relationship with China and rejected the country's debt trap image, adding that \"China provided concessionary loans for many infrastructure projects [during the post-conflict development].\" In regards to the Hambantota Port, he added, \"The Hambantota Port is not a debt trap.\" Rajapaksa dismissed the view that Sri Lanka was forced to enter a 99-year lease with a Chinese company because of a failure to pay the project's debts, stating that the project is commercially viable and is transforming Sri Lanka's overall port infrastructure.\n",
      "Deborah Bräutigam has disputed the usage of the term \"debt-trap diplomacy\". She said that the Canadian International Development Agency financed the Canadian engineering and construction firm SNC-Lavalin's feasibility study for the port, and its study concluded in 2003 that construction of a port at Hambantota was feasible. A second feasibility report, concluded in 2006 by the Danish engineering firm Ramboll, reached a similar conclusion.\n",
      "According to Bräutigam, the port in Hambantota had to secure only a fraction of the cargo which went through Singapore to justify its existence. Bräutigam was told by several Sri Lanka Central Bank governors that Hambantota (and Chinese finance in general) were not the major sources of the country's financial distress, and Bräutigam said that Sri Lanka did not default on any loans to China.\n",
      "Colombo had originally arranged a bailout from the IMF, but decided to raise the required funds by leasing the under-performing Hambantota Port to an experienced company as the Canadian feasibility study had recommended. Asanga Abeyagoonasekera, a Sri Lankan academic warned of a Chinese ‘strategic trap’ in Sri Lanka. Strategic-trap diplomacy term was coined by Asanga Abeyagoonasekera and published initially on 16 September 2021, assessing the Chinese Debt-trap diplomacy in Sri Lanka at an interview with Voice of America.\n",
      "Chatham House published a research paper in 2020 concluding that Sri Lanka's debt distress was unconnected to Chinese lending, but resulted more from \"domestic policy decisions\" facilitated by Western lending and monetary policy than from Chinese government policies. However while external debt owed to China was officially 10% of the total debt by April 2021, some officials said that China's total lending was much higher after taking into account loans to state-owned enterprises and the central bank.\n",
      "Local newspapers have published cartoons of Sri Lanka pleading for cash from neighboring SAARC countries. Indian observers have noted that the Colombo Port project with China has accelerated the country's debt crisis. According to Chinese state media, it is the largest project by China in Sri Lanka and has a total value of $1.4 billion. The damage to the once-prosperous tourism industry from the COVID-19 pandemic has also been blamed for failing to generate enough revenue to pay the country's debts.\n",
      "The Australian Lowy Institute said that Sri Lanka was \"not engulfed in a Chinese debt trap\", as 47% of Sri Lanka's external debt is owed to international capital markets, while 22% is held by multilateral development banks, followed by Japan having 10%. Supporters of the debt-trap theory noted that \"calculating the volume of loans provided by other foreign nations and sovereign bonds/private commercial loans vis-a-vis that from China is an oft quoted argument to dismiss the theory of debt-trap diplomacy\". In January 2022, President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa's office stated that it would appeal to China to reschedule its debt burden during talks with the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi. As of March 2022, there has been no official response from China.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Fall of foreign remittances ===\n",
      "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka under Cabraal attempted to maintain the Sri Lankan rupee pegged while continuing heavy money printing and strict exchange controls thus pushing down the market value of the rupee. Thus, by February 2022 while the government attempted to keep the currency pegged at Rs. 200/- to the United States dollar, the unofficial market value of the rupee exceeded 248 to the dollar. As a consequence, Sri Lanka's credibility among lenders has been undermined, further exacerbating the challenge of accessing international financial markets for borrowing purposes. This led to foreign workers remitting money through unofficial channels causing Sri Lankan banks to run out of foreign currency and foreign remittances to crash with a 61% reduction in official remittances in January 2022.\n",
      "In turn Cabraal threatened to freeze bank accounts of those that use unofficial money transmission methods. Then Cabraal began targeting merchandise and services exporters with exporter dollar surrender requirements forcing the residual after the utilization of export proceeds to be converted into rupees and forcefully converting dollars in forex accounts of resident Sri Lankans who earn dollar salaries ignoring concerns of this creating a similar situation to remittances.\n",
      "As Banks struggled, Cabraal issued warning letters to CEOs of banks demanding strict adherence to the fixed conversion rate. Former Deputy Governor of CBSL W.A Wijeywardana criticized the policies calling it \"Cabraalnomics 2.0\" noting that the dollars are disappearing from official markets while a superior dynamic black market has caused exporters and immigrants to shun the formal banking system resulting in dismantling the power of the Central Bank as the forex regulator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Tourism ===\n",
      "The country's tourism sector represented over one-tenth of the GDP of Sri Lanka. The sector was negatively affected by the 2019 Easter bombings, and the COVID-19 pandemic prevented recovery. Tourism earned Sri Lanka $4.4 billion and contributed 5.6% to GDP in 2018, but this dropped to just 0.8% in 2020. In a failed prediction in April 2021 the World Bank stated, “Despite the heavy toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on Sri Lanka's economy and the lives of its people, the economy will recover in 2021, though challenges remain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Agricultural crisis ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Sri Lanka had been self-sufficient in rice production with imports limited to specialty rice such as Basmati. In April 2021, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa announced that Sri Lanka would only allow organic farming, banning inorganic fertilizers and agrochemicals-based fertilizers. The drop in tea production resulting from the fertilizer ban alone resulted in economic losses of around $425 million and created a 20% drop in rice production within the first six months alone reversing previously achieved self-sufficiency in rice production and forcing the country to import rice for $450 million. The situation in the tea industry was described as critical, with farming under the organic program being described as ten times more expensive and producing half of the yield by the farmers.\n",
      "The program was welcomed by its advisor Vandana Shiva, but it ignored criticism from the scientific and farming communities who warned about the possible collapse of farming, including a financial crisis due to devaluation of national currency, which pivoted around the tea industry. Multiple claims by the government to justify the transition to organic agriculture were compared to Lysenkoism by critics: for example, Anuruddha Padeniya, a member of the Presidential task force that carried out the transition to organic farming, claimed that Pliny the Elder had claimed that ancient Sri Lankans had lived for around 140 years while modern agricultural methods have resulted in it being halved to 74 years.\n",
      "Both Padeniya and Gotabaya Rajapaksa has associated the use of chemical fertilizer with chronic kidney disease (CKDu), but scientific research has pointed towards high hardness of water due to high mineral concentration mainly of fluoride and magnesium of the water in areas with a high prevalence of CKDu combined with high heat as the most likely cause. The World Health Organization also doubted that chemical fertilizer use alone could cause CKDu.\n",
      "The banning of the trade of chemical fertilizers and pesticides produced a severe economic crisis, since the population expects to remain without income and without food. In November 2021, Sri Lanka abandoned its plan to become the world's first organic farming nation following rising food prices and weeks of protests against the plan. The government cancelled some measures, including lifting the ban on urea and importing 44,000 Tons of urea under the line of credit. Sri Lanka is seeking to introduce peacetime rationing of essential goods.\n",
      "On 29 May 2022 the government stated that the Yala season cultivation would fail with a forecast of 50% of the maximum harvest and that the government cannot provide fertilizer to save the season while rice stocks in the country will only be sufficient until September.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===\n",
      "The repercussions of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine are considered to have affected the already sluggish economic conditions of Sri Lanka. The invasion has further exacerbated the economic calamity of the country due to Russia being the second biggest market to Sri Lanka in tea exports and Sri Lanka's tourism sector is heavily reliant upon Russia and Ukraine, as most of the tourist arrivals are from the two nations.\n",
      "As a result, the Ukrainian crisis has put a halt to the economic recovery of Sri Lanka with both the tea and tourism sectors having been hit hard. On 13 July, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia is accountable for the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, accusing Russia of exacerbating a global food crisis and fueling inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Corruption and impunity ===\n",
      "A UN report in September 2022 highlighted that impunity of Sri Lankan officials for human rights violations and economic crimes in the country are reasons of its economic crisis. Sri Lanka ranks 102 in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Impact ==\n",
      "In 2021, the Sri Lankan Government officially declared the worst economic crisis in the country in 73 years. In August 2021, a food emergency was declared. However, the government denied food shortages. Sri Lanka's Energy Minister Udaya Gammanpila acknowledged the crisis could lead to a financial disaster. In early April 2022 the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Ajith Nivard Cabraal was replaced by Nandalal Weerasinghe. On 5 April, 41 members of the Parliament left the ruling coalition causing a loss of majority in the Parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Electricity and fuel shortages ===\n",
      " \n",
      "The economic crises has resulted in declines in electricity, fuel and cooking gas consumption, resulting from shortages. Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa urged all government authorities to switch off all street lights at least up until the end of March 2022 in an attempt to conserve electricity. Nearly 1000 bakeries have been shut as a response to shortages of cooking gas. Long queues have formed in recent months in front of petrol filling stations. The surge in global oil prices further aggravated the fuel shortage.\n",
      "In order to conserve energy, daily power cuts have been imposed by the authorities throughout the country. On 22 March 2022, the government ordered the military to post soldiers at various gas and fuel filling stations to curb the tensions among people who line up in queues and to ease the fuel distribution. Casualties include four fatalities due to fatigue and violence. Daily seven hour power cuts were seen throughout March 2022, increased to 10 hours at the end of the month and again increased to 15 hours in early April. As of July 2022, the daily power cuts were reduced to 3 hours a day.\n",
      "The dailies The Island and Divaina stopped print publication due to paper shortages and related price escalation and switched to e-papers. Sri Lanka's hydroelectricity generation has also been affected. On 28 June 2022, the government suspended fuel sales to non-essential vehicles. Only buses, trains, and vehicles used for medical services and transporting food could obtain fuel.\n",
      "Due to the shortage of aviation fuel, the country's flag carrier SriLankan Airlines have to make refuelling stopovers for its long-haul flights along with other international airlines flying to and from Sri Lanka, at airports in the Indian cities of Chennai, Kochi and Trivandrum. The Civil Aviation Authority in Sri Lanka has also published an advisory, requesting all international airlines to carry extra fuel while flying into Sri Lanka.\n",

The term test examinations were stated to be held island-wide on 28 March 2022, but due to the acute shortage of printing paper and ink ribbons, a decision was made to either cancel or postpone the exams to a later date.

      "Despite the growing concerns over the inflationary pressure, Ajith Nivard Cabraal, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), said in January 2022 that Sri Lanka does not need International Monetary Fund (IMF) relief, as he was optimistic that Sri Lanka could settle its mandatory outstanding debt, including its international sovereign debts. As of February 2022, the foreign reserves of Sri Lanka fell to US$2.36 billion. Sri Lanka has foreign debt obligations of $7 billion, including $1 billion worth sovereign bonds which is to be repaid by July 2022. The government is planning to hire a global law firm to provide technical support and assistance on debt restructuring.\n",

The IMF's executive board had discussed Sri Lanka's economy after the end of the annual discussions which took place on 25 February 2022. As of 25 February 2022, the IMF had declared that the public debt of Sri Lanka is unsustainable and warned the Sri Lankan government to refrain from printing money to prevent monetary instability, but lauded the vaccination drive which had cushioned the impact of the pandemic. The IMF had assessed the prevailing economic calamity of Sri Lanka by compiling an Article IV Consultation Assessment. In addition, the IMF predicted that the economy of Sri Lanka is expected to grow by 2.6 percent by 2022.\n",

The devaluation decision is also seen as a massive step-up in the country's attempt to seek IMF assistance and bailout. The former deputy governor of the CBSL, W. A. Wijewardana, criticized the monetary policy decisions undertaken by CBSL, especially for its decision to fix the rupee to Rs. 230/-, indicating that the FOREX crisis cannot be solved unless the floating exchange rate is implemented. Opposition MP Harsha de Silva opined that the devaluation of the rupee to Rs. 230/- is still insufficient and not enough to avert Sri Lanka's foreign reserve crisis.\n",
      "In March 2022 President Rajapaksa had made a statement that his government would work with IMF. On 7 April an expert presidential advisory group consisting of Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Shanta Devarajan, Sharmini Cooray was formed by the President to assist with the situation including proceedings with the IMF.\n",
      "The bailout talks got underway on 18 April 2022 in Washington with Ali Sabry on behalf of the government urged immediate emergency financial help through a loan package. The IMF initially insisted that any loans to Sri Lanka world require debt sustainability. IMF also considered Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) loans for Sri Lanka just like IMF used it to assist countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The IMF welcomed the Sri Lankan government's decisions and plans to hold negotiations with creditors. The IMF has pledged support for Sri Lanka to mitigate and solve the current economic crisis following the successful initial technical discussions between the Sri Lankan delegation led by finance minister Ali Sabry and the IMF officials in Washington. IMF termed the initial round of discussions as fruitful and vowed its assurance to help Sri Lanka overcome the economic crisis.\n",
      "The initial round of discussions included several topics including recent economic and financial developments in Sri Lanka and the need for implementing a credible and coherent strategy to restore macroeconomic stability. In addition to the assistance from IMF and World Bank, Sri Lanka is discussing with India some $1.5 billion in bridge financing to facilitate imports while also approaching China, Japan and Asian Development Bank for further financial assistance. The World Bank has agreed to provide financial relief of $600 million with $400 million to be released shortly under the first phase.\n",
      "On 20 June, an IMF delegation arrived in Colombo to discuss a rescue package. After the violent protests on 9 July which resulted in the resignation announcements of President Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, IMF said that it is hoping for a resolution to Sri Lanka's political turmoil that will allow a resumption of talks for a bailout package.\n",

On 7 April 2022, the Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) had also made an appeal to the government to solve the current economic and political crisis and had warned that if the issue had not been addressed with due diligence it could lead to closure of businesses.\n",
      "Former justice minister Ali Sabry had pleaded for political stability and insisted that Sri Lanka needs an immediate bailout or a moratorium from multilateral agencies such as the IMF, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank.

      "On 8 April 2022, former World Bank official Shanta Devarajan warned that the biggest risk Sri Lanka is going to face is social unrest and turmoil. He highlighted that a cash transfer program can be initiated aiming at helping the poor people in addition to the reduction in subsidies on food and fuel to avoid the collapse of the economy. Moody's Investors Service had warned that the wave of the resignation of cabinet ministers would only heighten policy uncertainty and as a result, it will make hard when obtaining or borrowing external finance.\n",

      "On 9 July 2022, Rajapaksa fled his official residence in Colombo prior to protesters breaking through police barricades and entering the premises. Protesters were seen occupying the mansion, even swimming in the president's pool. Later that evening the Speaker of the Parliament confirmed that the president would resign his office on 13 July 2022. On 11 July, the Prime Minister's Office also reconfirmed it. On 9 and 10 July, Rajapaksa's whereabouts were unknown to the public until Sri Lankan military sources told the BBC on 11 July, that the President was on a Navy vessel in Sri Lankan waters.

      "Over 100 law enforcement officers from multiple agencies responded to the shooting. The shooter ceased firing as law enforcement officers approached the building, causing the shooter to flee the scene and evade immediate capture. During his escape, the rifle Crimo used fell from his bag and was recovered by police within minutes. He then drove to the Madison, Wisconsin area, with a Kel-Tec SUB-2000 semiautomatic rifle in his car. He considered attacking another Independence Day celebration in Madison, but decided against it. He discarded his cell phone in Middleton, Wisconsin. \n",
      "A driver from Waukegan and his passengers spotted Crimo's damaged 2010 Honda Fit southbound on U.S Route 41 near Wadsworth. Over the next 13 minutes, they relayed information to 911 operators. Crimo was stopped by North Chicago and Lake Forest Police units at the intersection of U.S Route 41 and Westleigh Road in Lake Forest, Illinois, and apprehended without incident at approximately 6:30 p.m., more than eight hours after the shooting began.\n",

      "== Victims ==\n",
      "Seven people were killed and 48 others were injured by either bullets or shrapnel during the attack. Five of the victims—all adults—died at the scene, and two died at the hospital.\n",
      "Mexican authorities have said two men killed at the parade were \"natives of the country.\" One of these was a 78-year-old Mexican grandfather who was visiting family in the area, and another was a 69-year-old man. Three Jewish victims that were killed were a 63-year-old woman, an 88-year-old grandfather, and a 35-year-old woman. Another was a 64-year-old mother of two. The victims ranged in age from 8 to 88 years old. Highland Park Hospital reported that they were treating 26 people after the shooting, 25 being gunshot wounds, with five later transferred to Evanston Hospital. Additionally, four of the injured were transported to Glenbrook Hospital, and several others were taken to hospitals outside of the Northshore University Medical System network.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Investigation ==\n",
      "Highland Park authorities collaborated with the FBI, Illinois State Police, and Chicago Police during the investigation and manhunt. The police believe only one shooter was involved and the shooting was described as appearing to be \"very random (and) very intentional\". After his arrest, Crimo's home in Highwood, a small suburb just north of Highland Park, was raided by FBI agents.\n",
      "Lake County authorities alleged that Crimo planned the attack for weeks, and that he dressed in women's clothing and hid his facial tattoos in order to flee the scene after the attack, among panicked parade-goers. Mayor of Highland Park Nancy Rotering said that she believed that the weapon used in the crime was obtained legally. Police seized three rifles, one shotgun, and one handgun from Crimo.\n",
      "Crimo's motives remain unclear. The London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue said it appeared Crimo’s extensive online presence contained posts that gravitated toward far-right and neo-fascist ideologies. A Highland Park rabbi stated that, three months before the shooting, Crimo had entered Central Avenue Synagogue, a Chabad house, during the Passover Seder and was asked to leave. The Chabad House is located two blocks from where the July 4 shooting occurred. However, investigators have determined no racial or religious motivation for the shooting. Michael Masters, national director and CEO of the Secure Community Network headquartered in Chicago, said, \"Nothing overtly we have identified in his social media posts says this was an antisemitic attack, but we are coordinating with law enforcement. Apparently on social media, there are some indications he was ideating around the Fourth of July for some period of time, which would indicate this was not an attack on one particular community.\"\n",
      "According to experts on QAnon and conspiracy theory movements, Crimo's social media diet, while extreme, was distinct from the realm of QAnon. Mike Rothschild, an author who has written on QAnon, said, \"[T]he world Crimo lived in was pretty far off Q. He was in a 4chan bubble of ironic Nazi and anime memes, fascist-inspired music, and mass shooter ideation that basically consumes nothing but irony and sadness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Legal proceedings ==\n",
      "Robert Eugene Crimo III (born September 20, 2000) was charged on July 5 with seven counts of first-degree murder. The next day, he confessed to the shooting. Lake County Sheriff's Office said that he is being held without bail. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 28, 2022, but the hearing was obviated when a Lake County, Illinois grand jury indicted Crimo on July 27, 2022. Crimo was indicted on 117 felony counts: for each of the 7 deceased victims, three counts of first-degree murder (21 counts), and for each of the 48 victims struck by a bullet or shrapnel, one count of attempted murder (48 counts) and one count of aggravated battery (48 additional counts).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Accused ==\n",
      "Crimo attended Highland Park High School but dropped out before his junior year. He has performed under the stage name \"Awake the Rapper\" and posted his albums on Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music; music videos by him on YouTube depicted mass shootings and characters being shot by police. One video was accompanied by the narration \"I need to just do it. It is my destiny.\" The account is no longer available.\n",
      "Crimo frequently visited an online message board that discussed graphic depictions of death. He posted a video of a beheading the week before the shooting. He had his own Discord server, which was invaded by 4chan users after the shooting and has since been shut down. Stephen Harrison of Slate speculated he had used a single-purpose account on the English Wikipedia in an unsuccessful attempt to create an article about himself in 2017 and 2018. An account with the same username created articles about Crimo on the Fandom sites Wikitubia and the Rap Wiki.\n",
      "A voluble supporter of former President Donald Trump, Crimo frequented far-right gatherings, often wearing Where's Waldo garb, and confrontationally joined counterprotests.\n",
      "Police records and people who knew Crimo indicate that he came from a middle class but troubled household. When Crimo was two, his mother left him unattended on a hot August day inside a car with windows rolled up. She pleaded guilty to child endangerment and was ordered to undergo an evaluation at a child advocacy center. Between 2009 and 2014, police officers visited the Crimos' home nearly 20 times, nine of which involved reports of domestic violence. In 2010, Crimo's father reported that his wife struck him with a screwdriver but later retracted the accusation. Officers recommended that the couple go through marriage counseling or separate. Crimo's parents no longer live together.\n",
      "Law enforcement identified two prior encounters with Crimo: a 911 call in April 2019 reporting that he attempted to commit suicide and a September 2019 incident regarding alleged threats by Crimo to a family member. According to law enforcement, mental health professionals handled the suicide matter. In September 2019, police seized 16 knives, a dagger, and a sword from Crimo after a family member reported to the police that he planned to \"kill everyone\". Crimo's father said the weapons were his, however, and both parents denied Crimo had threatened anyone. He was not charged with a crime at the time, but a “clear and present danger report” was filed with the Illinois State Police. In December that year, Crimo applied for a Firearm Owner Identification card (FOID). It was sponsored by his father due to his young age. On either occasion, Highland Park police could have invoked Illinois' red flag law, which would have allowed them to seek a restraining order preventing Crimo from buying guns for up to six months. However, they did not pursue this option. Just four months later, in January 2020, Illinois State Police approved Crimo for a firearms permit, and he passed four background checks when buying firearms in 2020 and 2021. When asked why the \"clear and present danger\" report did not prevent Crimo from obtaining a FOID card, Illinois State Police said that Crimo denied that he would harm himself or others when questioned; moreover, \"no one, including family, was willing to move forward on a complaint\" or to provide pertinent information relating to threats or to mental health, any of which could have enabled further action by law enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Prison video calls ===\n",
      "In 2023, a 38-second video of Crimo from a prison phone call surfaced. In the video, Crimo claims the shooting was a \"false flag operation\". He also claims that his interview was a performance and he was tortured into falsifying evidence. The clip was filmed and posted by a woman who identifies herself as a \"registered nurse, mental health advocate, and investigative journalist\" on her conspiracy theory blog.\n",
      "Earlier that year, Crimo's video call privileges were revoked after he allegedly made a prank call to a New York Post reporter but his privileges were reinstated 30 days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Father ===\n",
      "Crimo's father, 58-year-old Robert Crimo Jr., who lived with the accused, said that there had been \"no warning signs\" immediately before the shooting. He stated that he does not regret sponsoring his son for an Illinois FOID card that allowed his son to legally purchase weapons even after incidents that raised red flags with police. Crimo Jr. described the entire situation as a nightmare, saying the family is shocked at the behavior because he believes his son was raised with good morals. He told the New York Post the day after the shooting that his son talked about the 2022 Copenhagen mall shooting and the 22-year-old Danish suspect the night before allegedly launching his own massacre, and avoided taking any responsibility or feeling guilt over how the suspect got his gun.\n",
      "Crimo Jr. is a Highland Park resident who also grew up in Highwood and Buffalo Grove. He lived with his wife, Highland Park native Denise Pesina Crimo, who had a criminal history dating back as far as mid-2002.\n",
      "On December 16, 2022, Crimo Jr. was arrested without incident and charged with seven counts of reckless conduct in relation to the shooting. Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart said that Crimo Jr. surrendered to Highwood Police; the charges are based on Crimo sponsoring his then-19-year-old son’s application for a gun license in 2019. The following morning on December 17, Crimo Jr. was released on $50,000 bond. On February 16, 2023, Crimo Jr. entered a not-guilty plea to the charges involving the 2019 acquirement of his son's gun license. On November 6, he pleaded guilty to seven misdemeanor counts of reckless conduct as part of a plea deal. He was sentenced to 60 days in prison and two years of probation. \n",

      "== Aftermath ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Multiple Chicago suburbs canceled their Fourth of July celebrations after the shooting. Six Flags Great America in Gurnee continued operating but canceled its fireworks show. The Chicago White Sox announced they would continue to play their baseball game against the Minnesota Twins but canceled their fireworks show.\n",
      "School districts in the surrounding neighborhoods said counseling service would be made available at Highland Park High School for \"students, staff and community members.\"\n",
      "The Ravinia Festival in Highland Park announced the cancellation of all concerts and events through July 10. \"This decision was made after careful consideration and in close consultation with many stakeholders, including neighbors, public officials, artists, and patrons. Our shared hope is that the reduced activity—both within the park and in the neighborhoods surrounding Ravinia—will give the community the space and quiet to reflect and heal.\"\n",
      "A GoFundMe campaign was established to benefit a two-year-old whose parents were both killed in the shooting. As of November 2023, over $3.2 million had been raised.\n",
      "Members of the North Chicago Police Department were honored on July 18 for their role in capturing Crimo. The North Chicago City Council presented six officers and one detective with letters of commendation.\n",
      "The Small Business Administration is offering low interest loans to small businesses and nonprofits in Lake County, Cook County, McHenry County, and Kenosha County that may have suffered economic setbacks because of the shooting.\n",
      "With the city's blessings, the Highland Park Community Foundation also offered grants to the victims and to nonprofit organizations helping those affected.\n",
      "On June 20, 2023, Highland Park resident Billy Corgan, owner of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), announced that the NWA would run a charity show for the benefit of Cooper Roberts, the youngest person wounded by gunfire, and his twin brother Luke, injured in the ensuing panic. Doctors had determined that Cooper would need to use a wheelchair for the rest of his life, requiring the family home to be retrofitted. The show was held on July 8 at the Highland Park Recreation Center. Funds for the family were raised by VIP tickets, sponsorships, donations, and a raffle.\n",
      "Despite assault weapons being banned in Highland Park since 2013 and the shooting taking place with a weapon not legally allowed in the town, the shooting spurred the state of Illinois to introduce an \"assault weapons ban\" bill which was signed into law on January 10, 2023, expanding Highland Park's ban of assault weapons throughout the state. This bill also included magazine capacity restrictions for rifles (10 rounds) and handguns (15 rounds), alongside many other provisions. The bill allowed anyone who owned any weapon considered an assault weapon before the bill was passed to keep it but required them to register it with the Illinois State Police within 300 days of the bill being signed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Reactions ==\n",
      "Crimo's parents released a statement through their attorney, stating: \"We are all mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and this is a terrible tragedy for many families, the victims, the paradegoers, the community, and our own. Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to everybody.\"\n",
      "President Joe Biden stated that he was shocked by the \"senseless\" gun violence and has offered the \"full support of the Federal government\" to the affected communities. He also called for gun control measures. Vice President Kamala Harris made a similar statement.\n",
      "Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker called the perpetrator a \"monster\" and stated that his office had made available all state resources to the community and was coordinating with local officials. He called for better gun control as well. Illinois U.S. Senator Dick Durbin called the attack \"horrific\" and \"senseless\". Gubernatorial candidate Darren Bailey advocated for \"prayer and action to address rampant crime and mental health issues,\" calling the attack a \"horrific tragedy\". Bailey later apologized after saying, \"...so let's pray for justice to prevail, and then let's move on and let's celebrate...\" about 90 minutes after the shooting.\n",
      "Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said the community had been shaken to its core. Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot released a statement about the shooting, calling it devastating and that she had been in contact with Mayor Rotering and offered the city's support with the Chicago Police Department providing assistance. She also stated the city grieved with the families of victims and the injured.\n",
      "Illinois State Senator Julie Morrison and U.S. Representative Brad Schneider were in attendance and expressed their condolences. Morrison expressed a sentiment that she would never want to be in another parade. Schneider stated he and his campaign team were safe and highlighted his commitment to make the community a safer place.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Misinformation ===\n",
      "Misinformation about the shooting spread on social media, including false claims that the shooter is transgender and that the shooting was a false flag operation. The far-right websites The Daily Wire and Disclose.tv posted tweets emphasizing the shooter's clothing, which subsequently resulted in transphobic narratives spreading online.\n",

      "Controversies involving Uber\n",
      "\n",
      "Uber, officially Uber Technologies Inc., has been the subject of controversies. Like other ridesharing companies, the company classifies its drivers as gig workers/independent contractors. This has become the subject of legal action in several jurisdictions. The company has disrupted taxicab businesses and allegedly caused an increase in traffic congestion. Ridesharing companies are regulated in many jurisdictions and the Uber platform is not available in several countries where the company is not able or willing to comply with local regulations. Other controversies involving Uber include various unethical practices such as aggressive lobbying and ignoring and evading local regulations. Many of these were revealed by a leak of documents showing controversial activity between 2013 and 2017 under the leadership of Travis Kalanick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Ignoring and evading local regulations ==\n",
      "Uber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is \"a technology company\" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber's strategy was generally to \"seek forgiveness rather than permission\". In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber's response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy. \n",
      "More than 124,000 Uber documents covering the five-year period from 2012 to 2017 when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick were leaked by Mark MacGann, a lobbyist who \"led Uber's efforts to win over governments across Europe, the Middle East and Africa\", to The Guardian newspaper and first printed on 10 July 2022 by its Sunday sister The Observer. The documents revealed attempts to lobby Joe Biden, Olaf Scholz and George Osborne; how Emmanuel Macron secretly aided Uber lobbying in France, and use of a kill switch during police raids to conceal data. Travis Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry, saying \"I think it's worth it, violence guarantees success\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Legal action from taxi companies ===\n",
      "Taxi companies sued Uber in numerous American cities, alleging that Uber's policy of violating taxi regulations was a form of unfair competition or a violation of antitrust law. Although some courts did find that Uber intentionally violated the taxi rules, Uber prevailed in every case, including the only case to proceed to trial. However, Uber agreed a $178 million payout in a similar class action lawsuit in Australia. The suit was filed by 8000 taxi drivers who claimed that Uber's entry into the Australian market resulted in major financial losses for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Greyball ===\n",
      "In March 2017, an investigation by The New York Times revealed that Uber developed a software tool called \"Greyball\" to avoid giving rides to known law enforcement officers in areas where its service was illegal such as in Portland, Oregon, Australia, South Korea, and China. The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose. The use of Greyball in London was cited by Transport for London as one of the reasons for its decision not to renew Uber's private hire operator licence in September 2017.\n",
      "Through the use of Greyball, Uber was capable of targeting selected individuals, for example local police, with a fake version of the app that displayed fake cars that would never arrive if contacted. This was developed with the intention of evading the law where the company's practices had been deemed illegal. Greyball was deployed in countries including Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Denmark, with the knowledge of senior management such as Kalanick and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty. Uber said that it stopped using the app in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Kill switch ===\n",
      "A January 2018 report by Bloomberg News stated that Uber routinely used a kill switch, codenamed \"Ripley\", that locked, powered off and changed passwords on staff computers when those offices were subjected to government raids. Uber allegedly used this button at least 24 times, from spring 2015 until late 2016. The existence of the kill switch was confirmed in documents leaked in 2022.\n",
      "When Uber offices were raided by police or regulatory agencies, the \"kill switch\" of which was not used until the very moment, was used to cut access to the data systems. This technique was used in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, India, Hungary and Romania. For example, it was reported that when the French competition regulator, the DGCCRF, raided Uber's offices in Paris, de Kievit asked an engineer in Denmark to \"please kill access now\". Similar procedures were used in Brussels and Amsterdam to prevent police accessing evidence. In the Netherlands, de Kievit was taken into custody and fined EUR750 for \"non-compliance with an official order\".\n",
      "The company claims the kill switches were not intended to obstruct justice, but rather to protect IP, customer privacy, and due process. It further claimed no data was permanently deleted, and was available for authorities to obtain later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Attempts to sabotage competitors ==\n",
      "In 2014, Uber employees were caught ordering and then quickly cancelling rides on competing services Lyft and Gett, in an attempt to disrupt these services. In 2014, Uber was also accused of recruiting people to use competing services for the sole purpose of recruiting their drivers to Uber, at which point the recruiter would receive a commission. Uber denied that it had any involvement with the cancellation of orders or the recruitment efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Wage disputes ==\n",
      "In January 2017, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of having misled drivers about potential earnings.\n",
      "In 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of thousands of Uber drivers, alleging that Uber’s “upfront prices” policy did not provide drivers with the 80% of fares to which they were entitled. The lawsuit was settled for $345,622, with each driver in the class getting at least $20.\n",
      "In May 2017, after the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court in New York, Uber admitted to underpaying New York City drivers tens of millions of dollars over 2.5 years by calculating driver commissions on a net amount. Uber agreed to pay the amounts owed plus interest.\n",

      "\n",
      "== Boycott in the US ==\n",
      "In late January 2017, GrabYourWallet advised to boycott Uber because the company did not join its Protests against Executive Order 13769, while Travis Kalanick, then CEO of Uber, was a member of Donald Trump's \"business advisory council\" and GrabYourWallet was advising boycotts of businesses with ties to Trump. Approximately 200,000 users deleted the Uber mobile app. On February 2, 2017, Kalanick resigned from the council, which disbanded in August 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Sexual harassment ==\n",
      "On February 19, 2017, former Uber engineer Susan Fowler published on her website that she was propositioned for sex by a manager and subsequently threatened with termination of employment by another manager if she continued to report the incident. Kalanick was alleged to have been aware of the complaint. On February 27, 2017, Amit Singhal, Uber's Senior Vice President of Engineering, was forced to resign after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment claim against him that occurred while he served as Vice President of Google Search. After investigations led by former attorney general Eric Holder and Arianna Huffington, a member of Uber's board of directors, in June 2017, Uber fired over 20 employees. Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to \"dig up dirt\" on the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each. In December 2019, Kalanick resigned from the board of directors of the company and sold his shares.\n",

      "== God view and privacy concerns ==\n",
      "In November 2014, then U.S. Senator Al Franken, Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, expressed concerns regarding ride sharing privacy, specifically Uber's \"God View\", whereby the whereabouts of specific customers, including journalists and politicians, are able to be tracked by Uber insiders. In December 2014, in response to Franken, Uber implemented restrictions on that function.\n",
      "In 2012, an Uber employee tracked the frequency of probable one-night stands in six U.S. cities by day and neighborhood, by correlating late-night and next-day trips. The blog posting coined the term \"ride of glory\" for the Uber equivalent of a walk of shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Delayed disclosure of data breaches ==\n",
      "On February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months prior. Names and license plate information from approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014, but waited more than five months to notify the affected individuals.\n",
      "An announcement in November 2017 revealed that in 2016, a separate data breach had disclosed the personal information of 600,000 drivers and 57 million customers. This data included names, email addresses, phone numbers, and drivers' license information. Hackers used employees' usernames and passwords that had been compromised in previous breaches (a \"credential stuffing\" method) to gain access to a private GitHub repository used by Uber's developers. The hackers located credentials for the company's Amazon Web Services datastore in the repository files, and were able to obtain access to the account records of users and drivers, as well as other data contained in over 100 Amazon S3 buckets. Uber paid a $100,000 ransom to the hackers on the promise they would delete the stolen data. Uber was subsequently criticized for concealing this data breach. Khosrowshahi publicly apologized. In September 2018, in the largest multi-state settlement of a data breach, Uber paid $148 million to the Federal Trade Commission, admitted that its claim that internal access to consumers' personal information was closely monitored on an ongoing basis was false, and stated that it had failed to live up to its promise to provide reasonable security for consumer data. Also in November 2018, Uber's British divisions were fined £385,000 (reduced to £308,000) by the Information Commissioner's Office.\n",
      "In 2020, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against former Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan for obstruction of justice. The criminal complaint said Sullivan arranged, with Kalanick's knowledge, to pay a ransom for the 2016 breach as a \"bug bounty\" to conceal its true nature, and for the hackers to falsify non-disclosure agreements to say they had not obtained any data.\n",

      "== Tax evasion ==\n",
      "In November 2017, the Paradise Papers, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to offshore investment, revealed that Uber is one of many corporations that used an offshore company to minimize taxes.\n",
      "London-based executive Fraser Robinson was asked to move to Amsterdam to persuade UK tax collectors that the company was not partly managed in the UK. (Under UK law, being partly managed in the UK, for example by having senior executives in London, would make a company taxable in the UK.)

      "== Racial discrimination ==\n",
      "In October 2020, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all non-White drivers, alleging there was racial discrimination in how it uses passengers’ reviews to evaluate drivers. Driver evaluation relies on Uber's star rating system, which the lawsuit says disproportionately leads to the firing of people who are not white or who speak with accents. The case argues that \"Uber’s reliance on customer ratings to determine driver termination constitutes race discrimination, as it is widely recognized that customer evaluations of workers are frequently racially biased.\" The lawsuit was dismissed in August 2021 due to lack of evidence to prove that the rating system has a racially disparate impact and that Uber intentionally discriminated against the lead plaintiff. However, the judge acknowledged the plausibility of the case and granted permission to file a new complaint.\n",
      "In October 2021, Uber was sued in London over allegations that its facial recognition system is not able to effectively identify people with darker skin and has precluded some people from using the platform, thereby discriminating against people of color.\n",

      "On 5 December 2014, a passenger was assaulted in an Uber cab by its driver in New Delhi. Following this, Uber was temporarily withdrawn and then forced to manage operations through an Indian subsidiary. Uber also ran into disputes with the Reserve Bank of India, the Income Tax department and consumer courts. Following this, a 'kill switch' was used to prevent Indian authorities accessing evidence. Uber Manager Rob van der Woude described the system in an e-mail - \"what we did in India is have the city team be as cooperative as possible and have [Uber] BV take the heat. E.g. Whenever the local team was called to provide the information, we shut them down from the system making it practically impossible for them to give out any info despite their willingness to do so. At the same time we kept directing the authorities to talk to [Uber] BV representatives instead.\" In another mail, Allen Penn, Uber's Asia head, told employees \"we will generally stall, be unresponsive, and often say no to what they want. This is how we operate and it’s nearly always the best\". The Indian Express also found that in most Uber cabs, safety features mandated by the Delhi Government, such as a panic button, were not present or did not work.\n",

Warned that \"extreme right thugs\" had infiltrated the protest and were \"spoiling for a fight\", he was quoted as saying that \"violence guarantee[s] success\".\n",
      "The Washington Post reported that the documents, together with interviews with Uber drivers, showed that Uber knowingly created working conditions that resulted in its drivers barely scraping by, and created a system that rewarded drivers for taking routes and schedules that put them at risk of harm in violence-plagued areas.\n",

      "== Arbitration agreements and class action waivers ==\n",
      "Uber's arbitration clause and class action waiver in its driver and rider terms of service, which requires that both the rider/driver and Uber waive their rights file a lawsuit in court against the company, has come under significant scrutiny by the Pennsylvania Superior Court. Uber's arbitration clause was found to be in violation of the Pennsylvania state Constitution numerous times between 2022 and 2023. The Superior Court of Pennsylvania, an appellate court in the state, ruled in a 2023 lawsuit against the company by Shannon and Keith Chilutti that the right to a jury trial is enshrined deeply in the state constitution, and any waiver of it must be placed in bold text at the top of a contract. According to Bloomberg Law correspondent Chris Marr, the Chilutti ruling places Pennsylvania as having one of the strongest protections against arbitration clauses.\n",
      "Judge Daniel D. McCaffery, in a 2-1 majority with judge Alice Beck Dubow concurring, ruled that even though a Ninth Circuit ruling in Berman v. Freedom Financial Network, which itself found that \"browsewrap\" agreements are enforceable where there is conspicuous notice provided by one party to the other as well as an action required to assert agreement, would find that Uber's agreement is conscionable, Pennsylvania's constitution requires a more stringent set of procedures in order to make clear to all parties there is an \"unambiguous manifestation of assent to arbitration\", which was failed to be provided to the Chilutti's. The dissenting judge, Victor P. Stabile, rejected McCaffery's assessment on procedural grounds, writing that the appealed trial court's order to compel arbitration was not the final ruling in the case.\n",
      "Lawyers for Uber, which included attorneys from law firms Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Vaughan Baio & Partners, did not comment to Bloomberg law, though an attorney for the Chiluttis from Messa & Associates P.C, Joseph L. Messa Jr., commended the Superior Court's ruling and its broad implication for Pennsylvania businesses. Messa blasted the concept of arbitration agreements in his praise for the court, arguing that he can’t think of any other constitutional right you give up by clicking an agreement to purchase a service\".\n",

      "\n",
      "On December 3, 2022, a shooting attack was carried out on two electrical distribution substations located in Moore County, North Carolina, United States. Damage from the attack left up to 40,000 residential and business customers without electrical power. Initial estimates were that up to four days could be required to fully restore power in the area. A state of emergency and corresponding curfew were enacted by local government officials in the wake of the incident.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "Less than two weeks prior to the Moore County substation incident, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had sent a report to private industry in which they stated that there had been an increase in reported threats to electric infrastructure from people who espouse “racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideology\", with an aim of creating civil disorder and inspiring further violence. The Department of Homeland Security cited\n",
      "\n",
      "a 14-page document released in a Telegram channel favored by accelerationist groups seeking to speed the overthrow of the US government featured a white supremacist instruction guide to low-tech attacks meant to bring chaos, including how to attack a power grid with guns.\n",
      "While it is unclear whether such threats are directly associated with this attack, government officials have previously expressed concern over the possibility of violent extremists attacking the electrical grid. Prior to the Moore County attack, other attacks on the electrical grid had occurred in Metcalf, California in 2013, in Arkansas in 2013, in Utah in 2016, and in Washington and Oregon (dates undisclosed).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Attack ==\n",
      "According to Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields, a Duke Energy power substation was severely damaged by gunfire in Carthage at around 7 p.m. Gunfire was later directed at a second substation in West End, ultimately resulting in a loss of electrical power to the majority of the county. A journalist from a local newspaper reported that one of the substations' gates had been damaged and was lying in an access road, with the pole holding the gate having been snapped off at the ground.\n",
      "Outages began starting just after 7 p.m. on December 4 in Moore County and spread to central and southern parts of the county, with roughly 36,000 customers reported to be without power. Duke Energy officials indicated that significant, serious damage had occurred to equipment located at the substations and that repairs could take several days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Investigation ==\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the Moore County Sheriff's Department, the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, and police departments from all eleven municipalities in Moore County are participating in the investigation. The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) of the Department of Energy is also reported to be assisting.\n",
      "Investigators revealed that they had recovered about two dozen shell-casings, described as being from a \"high powered rifle\", from the attack sites. These casings were expected to be used to query the National Integrated Ballistic Information Network for possible matches with casings fired from the same weapon at other crime scenes. The casings, some of the only physical evidence available, were also being looked at as a starting point which could lead to other evidence such as tire tracks or shoe prints.\n",
      "On December 7, 2022, Governor Roy Cooper announced that a reward of up to $75,000 was being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case. The money consists of three separate $25,000 rewards, offered by the State of North Carolina, Duke Energy, and Moore County.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Motive ===\n",
      "Officials have described the attack as \"targeted\" and \"intentional, willful and malicious\" but did not immediately provide any information on suspects or a motive for the attack.\n",
      "After the incident, numerous posts on the internet have speculated that the attack was an attempt to disrupt a local drag show that was taking place in the nearby town of Southern Pines that evening; however, these claims are unconfirmed and disputed.\n",
      "By December 7, investigators were focusing on two possible motives for the attack. One scenario relates to known online writings by domestic extremists, which encourage attacks on critical infrastructure; the other relates to anti-LGBTQ+ activity. Investigators said they still have no evidence specifically tying the attack to the contemporaneous drag show, but the timing of the two incidents, as well as a general growth in tension around LGBTQ+ events, leads them to consider a possible connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Aftermath ==\n",
      "As of December 6, it was estimated that about 35,000 Moore County residents were still without power, and the timeline for completing repairs and restoring power county-wide was revised from December 8 to midnight December 7. By the morning of December 7, the number of affected residents without power was down to about 23,000, and power had been restored to the Moore County hospital. Additionally, the Duke Energy website stated \"All substation equipment damaged from recent vandalism has either been fully repaired or replaced.\" By 4 p.m. on December 7, the number of customers remaining without power had dropped to approximately 1,200. As a result, it was announced that the curfew would be permanently lifted as of 5 a.m. on the morning of December 8.\n",
      "A Moore County resident died during the power outage and investigators are determining whether the death was related to the outage, which could have implications for any criminal charges.\n",
      "As a result of the power outage, Moore County Regional Hospital was forced to operate on generator power. The town of Southern Pines also had to resort to operating their sewer and water services on backup generators. Residents of the area were asked to stay off the roads if possible or proceed with caution due to the absence of traffic lights.\n",
      "On December 4, a curfew was placed in effect for Moore County, from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m. The nightly curfew was expected to remain in effect until the power was restored. A shelter was established at the Moore County Sports Complex, and Moore County schools were ordered closed from December 5 through December 8 as a result of the power outage.\n",
      "On 30 August 2023, the death of Karin Zoanelli, an 87-year-old woman who died during the power outage, was ruled a homicide by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of North Carolina. A resident of Pinehurst, Zoanelli suffered from chronic lung problems and was dependent on an oxygen machine to breathe at night. The machine was rendered inoperable after her house lost power which contributed to her death, according to the medical examiner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Responses ==\n",
      "During a press conference shortly after the attacks, Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields claimed the substations were targeted and that attack was intentional. Fields also claimed that the perpetrators most likely knew what they were doing but did not state that the attacks may have been domestic terrorism. The sheriff also reported that his office has not been able to tie anything back to a drag show in Southern Pines, scheduled around the time the power went out, thereby addressing a rumor that began on social media.\n",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby advised that the White House was monitoring the situation closely, and emphasized the importance of shoring up the security of the infrastructure.\n",
      "North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper issued a statement via Twitter, saying, \"An attack like this on critical infrastructure is a serious, intentional crime and I expect state and federal authorities to thoroughly investigate and bring those responsible to justice.\"\n",

      "2023 Manipur violence\n",
      "\n",
      "On 3 May 2023, ethnic violence erupted in India's north-eastern state of Manipur between the Meitei people, a majority that lives in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki-Zo tribal community from the surrounding hills. According to government figures, as of 28 February 2024, 219 people have been killed in the violence and 60,000 people have been displaced. Earlier figures also mentioned over 1,000  injured, and 32 missing. 4,786 houses were burnt and 386 religious structures were vandalized, including temples and churches. Unofficial figures are higher.\n",
      "The proximate cause of the violence was a row over an affirmative action measure. On 14 April 2023, acting on a writ petition, the Manipur High Court ordered the state government to send a recommendation to the central government on the demand for a Scheduled Tribe status by the valley-based Meitei community, a decision later criticised by the Supreme Court. To protest the Meitei demands for the scheduled tribe status, the All Tribal Students' Union Manipur conducted peaceful protest marches on 3 May. After one of these marches, clashes broke out between Kuki and Meitei groups near the border between the Churachandpur district and Bishnupur district, followed by house burning.\n",
      "The violence quickly spread to the Kuki-dominated Churachandpur town and the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley, targeting the minority community in each area. According to Reuters, 77 Kukis and 10 Meiteis were killed within a week.\n",
      "In addition to the ST status, other issues had been festering prior to the violence. For example, the Kuki people in the hill districts saw themselves as being the target of the state government's treatment of indigenous land rights concerns.\n",
      "There have been evictions of Kuki communities as a result of efforts to survey forests, which were ostensibly made to stop the cultivation of poppy.\n",
      "The Meitei community has also experienced a rise in insecurity as a result of the flood of refugees from Myanmar following the military coup in 2021, particularly those from the Sagaing region. In one of the instances, the Manipur government have questioned the central security forces, especially the Assam Rifles, of allowing illegal immigration from Myanmar. Many organisations have protested against Assam Rifles of siding with the Kuki communities, including instance of Manipur police filing FIR against its personnel for enabling Kuki militants to escape by obstructing the police movements.\n",
      "According to several organisations, there have been accounts of partisan killings by security forces, as well as allegations of the police siding with the Meitei community.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Manipur is a state in northeast India, bordering Myanmar to its east and south. It consists of the Imphal Valley, associated with the Manipur kingdom, and the surrounding hills populated by hill tribes. The Imphal Valley constitutes about 10% of the geographical area of the state with 57% of the population, predominantly Meitei, who are majority Hindus, with minorities of Muslims and native Sanamahism followers. The surrounding hills constitute 90% of the geographical area of the state with 43% of the population belonging to 34 tribal groups broadly categorized as Nagas and Kukis. The Nagas dominate the northern districts while the Kukis are predominant in the south. The tribal people have the Scheduled Tribe (ST) status, whereas the Meitei have been accorded Other Backward Class (OBC) status, with some classified as Scheduled Castes (SC) in certain areas.\n",
      "Scholars write that the hill tribes, whose administration had largely been left to the respective chiefs known as Khullakpa by the Meitei Kings, came to be administered by the British after the Anglo-Manipur War of 1891. The British administrative control became more intensive after the Kuki Rebellion of 1917–19 and they continued to administer the hill areas directly until 1947. Scholars believe the colonial administration employed the \"divide and rule\" policy which widened existing divide between the peoples. On the contrary, the hill regions are noted by some scholars as forming part of Zomia inhabited by \"non-state\" peoples. They came to be administered only after the Kuki Rebellion of 1917–1919, by British administrators without the involvement of the Meitei state. After Indian independence, the hill tribes continued to enjoy a protected status. Even though the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribals except by special permission, the seventh amendment (2015) is seen as an attempt by the valley dwellers to grab tribal land. The valley-based Meitei dominate the political establishment. Of the 60 Assembly constituencies, 40 are held by the valley and 20 are in the hill districts. The tribal population is not prohibited from settling in the valley region. Kukis state that they do not want to come to the valley but they have to since there are no roads, schools or hospitals in the hills.\n",
      "Tribal groups have complained that the government spending is unduly concentrated in the Meitei-dominated Imphal Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Scheduled Tribe status for Meitei ===\n",
      "The Scheduled Tribe Demand Committee of Manipur (STDCM) began demanding Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Meitei people in 2012. The STDCM claims the status will restore the harmonious relationship between the valley and the hills peoples before the Manipur's merger with India in 1949. On the other hand, the hills people view this demand as an attempt to reduce the effectiveness of the Naga and Kuki demands, and enable the Meitei to make inroads into the hill regions.\n",
      "It was reported later that the Union government and the state government had considered the issue of ST status for Meitei twice, once in 1982 and a second time in 2001, and rejected it both times. This fact was not publicised at the beginning of the conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Political background ===\n",
      "Okram Ibobi Singh of the Indian National Congress (INC) had been in power for three terms from 2002. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2017 for the first time under the leadership of N. Biren Singh who managed to out-maneuver the INC, the single largest party, and formed a minority government. In the 2022 Manipur Legislative Assembly election, Biren Singh led the BJP to a clear majority increasing the seat tally from 21 (2017) to 32 (2022) in an Assembly of 60 and continued as the Chief Minister. The rise of BJP power in Manipur has empowered the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to incite the Vaishnavite Meitei to assert Hindutva politics against religious minorities. This included giving rise to Meitei-based organisations and increased vigilantism, cultural policing, and anti-minority rhetoric.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Refugees from Myanmar ===\n",
      "The renewed outbreak of civil war in Myanmar in neighbouring Chin state has also been claimed to be a reason for the violence in Manipur. Fighting in the Chin theater has caused an influx of refugees in the states of Manipur and Mizoram. As of May 2023, according to the chief minister, 2,000 refugees had entered Manipur and were housed in shelters. Other estimates put the number between 5,000 and 10,000. Rumours have circulated that Chin refugees are receiving assistance from Kuki villagers and are helping to enhance the \"political clout\" of the Kukis.\n",
      "This has caused the Meiteis to brand all Kukis as \"illegal immigrants\".\n",
      "Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah stated that the influx of Kuki people from Myanmar created insecurity amongst the Meitei people of Manipur and triggered the violence.\n",

      "China perceives that India's Act East Policy, and closer relations with Southeast Asian nations pose a serious threat to its ambition to establish its hegemony in the region. On 15th August 2023, Chief Minister of Manipur, N Biren Singh said that certain misunderstandings, actions of vested interests and foreign conspiracies to destabilise the state led to widespread violence in Manipur.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Antecedents ==\n",
      "\n",
      "On 7 November 2022, the Government of Manipur passed an order setting aside previous orders from the 1970s and 1980s that excluded villages from proposed Churachandpur-Khoupum protected forest, which automatically placed 38 ancestral villages in Churachandpur in the encroaching category. In February 2023, the BJP state government began an eviction drive in districts of Churachandpur, Kangpokpi and Tengnoupal, declaring the forest dwellers as encroachers—a move seen as anti-tribal.\n",
      "In March, the Manipur Cabinet decided to withdraw from the Suspension of Operation agreements with three Kuki militant groups, including the Kuki National Army and the Zomi Revolutionary Army, though the central government did not support such a withdrawal. Several Manipuri organisations also demonstrated in New Delhi to press for a National Register of Citizens (NRC) to be created with 1951 as the base year, complaining of abnormal population growth in hill areas. The first violence broke out as five people were injured in a clash in the Kangpokpi district, where protesters gathered to hold a rally against \"encroachment of tribal land in the name of reserved forests, protected forests and wildlife sanctuary\". While, the state cabinet stated that the government will not compromise on \"steps taken to protect the state government's forest resources and for eradicating poppy cultivation\". Social scientists, such as Dhanabir Laishram, have argued that targeting those poor Kuki cultivators alone would be futile. A rich section of the Meitei community is blamed to be one of the major funders. On 11 April, three churches in Imphal's Tribal Colony locality were razed for being illegal constructions on government land.\n",
      "On 20 April 2023, a judge of the Manipur High Court directed the state government to \"consider request of the Meitei community to be included in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list.\" The Kukis feared that the ST status would allow the Meiteis purchase land in the prohibited hilly areas.\n",
      "The Indigenous Tribal Leaders' Forum (ITLF) called for a total shut down on 28 April in protest of the state government actions, a day that also happened to have been scheduled for the chief minister N. Biren Singh to visit Churachandpur for the inauguration of an open air gym. The day before the visit, a mob set fire to the gym and vandalised it. The ITLF claimed that it started the agitation as the state government was not addressing the plight of the people. Section 144 was invoked on 28 April as well as a five-day Internet shut down. The protesters clashed with the police and tear gas shells were used to disperse the mobs.\n",
      "What has been said, openly, including by Chief Minister Biren Singh, is that too many “foreign” (Myanmar Kukis) are involved, there is foreign (Chinese, he insinuated) hand, and that the Kuki tribals are forest encroachers, illicit poppy growers, drug smugglers and terrorists. “Terrorist” is an expression he has used for them more than once and it has been widely reported in the national broadsheets.\n",

      "=== Initial riots ===\n",
      "\n",
      "On 3 May, the tribal organisation All Tribal Student Union Manipur (ATSUM), opposing the Meitei demand for ST status, conducted a \"Tribal Solidarity March\". Tens of thousands of protesters participated in the march across all hill districts of Manipur. According to the Union Home Ministry, the call for the march also generated a \"counter response\" by the Meitei. Reports were received of a counter-blockade at Torbung near the Bishnupur–Churachandpur district border, and a counter-agitation in the surrounding valley areas (such as the Kangvai village), where houses were attacked by Meitei mobs.\n",
      "Two dead bodies were discovered in the Kangvai village and tyres were burnt at the base of the Anglo-Kuki War Memorial gate at Leisang as an apparent provocation.\n",
      "After the reportedly peaceful rally in the Churachandpur town in which 100,000 people participated, rallyists returning to the Torbung–Kangvai area faced the \"counter-blockade\" by the Meitei groups. This resulted in stone-throwing and arson of vehicles and properties. The Kangvai village in the Bishnupur district was burnt down. These events caused a large number of Kuki-Zo people from Churachandpur side to rush to the clash site and participate in the clashes, including the burning of the Bangla village in Churachandpur district. About 80 people were injured in the violence who were taken to the Churachandpur District Hospital, of which three people died by the next morning.\n",
      "By the evening, clashes spread to the Churachandpur town, where Meitei settlements were attacked, and the Imphal City, where Kuki-Zo settlements were attacked. Violence continued through the night of 3 May. Residences and churches of the Kuki tribal population were attacked in the valley areas. According to the police, many houses of the tribal population in Imphal were attacked and 500 occupants were displaced and had to take shelter in Lamphelpat. Around 1000 Meiteis affected by the violence also had to flee from the region and take shelter in Bishnupur. Twenty houses were burnt in the city of Kangpokpi.  Violence was observed in Churachandpur, Kakching, Canchipur, Soibam Leikai, Tengnoupal, Langol, Kangpokpi and Moreh while mostly being concentrated in the Imphal Valley during which several houses, places of worship and other properties were burnt and destroyed.\n",
      "On 4 May, fresh cases of violence were reported. The police force had to fire several rounds of tear gas shells to control the rioters. Kuki MLA Vunzjagin Valte (BJP), who is the representative of the tribal headquarters of Churachandpur, was attacked during the riots while he was returning from the state secretariat. His condition was reported to be critical on 5 May, while a person accompanying him died. The government said around 1700 houses and numerous vehicles were burned down during the violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Government response ===\n",
      "A curfew was imposed across eight districts, including non-tribal dominated Imphal West, Kakching, Thoubal, Jiribam, and Bishnupur districts, as well as tribal-dominated Churachandpur, Kangpokpi, and Tengnoupal districts.\n",
      "The Manipur government issued a shoot at sight order on 4 May. By the end of 3 May, 55 columns of the Assam Rifles and the Indian Army were deployed in the region and by 4 May, more than 9,000 people were relocated to safer locations. By 5 May, about 20,000 and by 6 May, 23,000 people had been relocated to safe locations under military supervision. The central government airlifted 5 companies of the Rapid Action Force to the region. Nearly 10,000 army, paramilitary and Central Armed Police Forces were deployed in Manipur. As of 14 May, the total military build up in Manipur stood at 126 army columns and 62 companies of paramilitary forces.\n",
      "On 4 May, it was widely reported that the Union government had invoked the Article 355 of the Indian Constitution to take over the security situation of Manipur. However, no notification was issued to this effect. Nevertheless, the Home Ministry appointed a security advisor to the Manipur chief minister, Kuldip Singh, who previously headed the CRPF, and an overall commander for the law and order situation, Ashutosh Sinha.\n",
      "The insertion of troops led to several engagements between hill-based militants and the Indian Reserve Battalion, resulting in at least five militant deaths. In a separate encounter, four militants were killed. By 6 May the situation had calmed down to a degree. According to journalist Moses Lianzachin, at least twenty-seven churches were destroyed or burned down during the violence. As of 9 May, according to the Manipur government, the death toll was over 60 people. The situation was described as \"relatively peaceful\" on 10 May, with the curfew being relaxed in places, though unknown militants fired on Indian troops in an incident in Manipur's Imphal East district, injuring one.\n",
      "On 12 May, suspected Kuki militants ambushed policemen in Bishnupur district, killed one officer and injuring five others. In a separate incident, a soldier was stabbed and three Meitei community members kidnapped in Torbung, Churachandpur district. A day later, the security advisor to the Manipur Government Kuldeep Singh raised the total fatality count from the violence to more than 70 deaths. This included the discovery of three Public Works Department labourers found dead in a vehicle in the Churachandpur from unknown causes. He added the number of internally displaced people living in camps had been significantly reduced, and that about 45,000 people had been relocated to other areas.\n",
      "On 14 May, a delegation of state ministers led by Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh left for New Delhi to meet Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss the situation.\n",
      "The internet blackout and curfew remained in place on 16 May. Food was also reported to be scarce, with shops, schools and offices closed, and thousands of people stranded in refugee camps. Fresh violence over the weekend had led to further displacements. On 17 May, the internet blackout was extended for five more days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Recurrent violence ===\n",

      "On July 19, a video went viral showing two Kuki women, one aged in her forties and another in her twenties, being stripped, paraded naked on the streets, slapped and sexually assaulted by presumably Meitei men. The women were forcibly taken away from the police station when they were fleeing mob violence. The younger victim was allegedly gang-raped and one of the victims' father and teenage brother were killed by the mob while trying to protect the victim. Despite the complaint being lodged no action was taken by the police for more than 2 months until the video emerged. The Kuki community have accused the police of siding with the Meitei community. The video emerged after more than two months since the incident took place as internet was shutdown in Manipur. One of the victims said that they have been “left to the mob by the police”. On July 20, Manipur Chief Minister Biren Singh defended his decision to curtail Internet access in the state, citing hundreds of similar incidents occurring in the past. The Union government ordered social media platforms to remove  all posts showing the viral video. Seven arrests were made in the case, all of them after the viral video surfaced.\n",

      "On 12 May 2023, all 10 Kuki MLAs, including eight from the Bharatiya Janata Party, issued a statement demanding a separate body be created to administer their community under the constitution of India in the wake of the violent ethnic clashes. They alleged that the violence had been “tacitly supported” by the BJP-run state government, and that living under a Meitei-majority administration after the violence would be “as good as death” for their community. Five organisations of tribal students of Manipur in New Delhi also demanded a probe into the alleged involvement of two radical Meitei groups, Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun in the violence.\n",
      "The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in a statement that the violence in Manipur \"revealed the underlying tensions between different ethnic and indigenous groups\". He urged the authorities to \"respond to the situation quickly, including by investigating and addressing root causes of the violence in line with their international human rights obligations\".\n",
      "On 29 May, hundreds of women from Kuki, Mizo, and Zomi tribes staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, demanding intervention by the central government to end communal tensions in Manipur. The women waved national flags and held posters declaring themselves as Indians, not immigrants, while criticising the state government stirring  tensions by evicting of Kuki villagers from reserve forest land.\n",
      "On 30 May 2023, eleven international and national award-winning sportspersons from the state said that they will return their awards if the territorial integrity of the state is compromised.

      "On 20 July 2023, Modi broke his months-long silence after a video of two women being paraded naked and subjected to blatant acts of sexual assault by a group of men went viral. He said the incident shamed India and that no guilty will be spared. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been criticized for being silent on the violence for almost three months, for not visiting the state and for avoiding the broader situation in his statement after a video showing two women being paraded naked went viral.\n",
      "On 27 July 2023, the BJP's Bihar wing leader, Vinod Sharma, resigned alleging that the violence in the state has defamed the country.\n",
      "On 7 August 2023, Kuki People's Alliance withdrew their support to the BJP government of the state led by N. Biren Singh.\n",
      "The parliamentary opposition under the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) tabled a no confidence motion about the crisis on August 10 in order to make Modi address the situation in more detail to parliament. Modi delivered a two hour speech mainly focused on the accomplishments of his government and criticising the opposition for \"defaming India\" through the vote, to which opposition MLAs walked out. Afterwards, Modi addressed the conflict, stating that \"there would soon be peace in Manipur\" and that the whole country would get behind resolution efforts. The motion failed as expected due to the overwhelming BJP majority, with it being seen more as a way to force Modi to speak about the matter and showcase the unity and power of the INDIA grouping.\n",

      "== Media coverage ==\n",
      "Mainstream television channels from India ignored the Manipur conflict for a while, and covered it only after a viral video surfaced showing two naked women being paraded by a mob. Major newspapers and broadcast media from Manipur and the rest of India have avoided reporting on violence faced by the Christian-majority Kukis, while highlighting violence by Kuki militants. Three of the most read English newspapers in the region did not even report on the incident of a mob burning a woman and a boy alive. The Sangai Express referred to Kukis by the adjective \"aliens\" in an editorial, while an editorial in the Imphal Free Press justified the villagers looting arms from the security forces in the state.\n",
      "On 21 July, ANI incorrectly reported that a Muslim man has been arrested in connection to the incident in which two naked women were seen paraded forcibly by a mob in a viral video. ANI later apologized for the tweet, saying that it was based on an erroneous reading of previously published tweets by Manipur Police.\n",

      "2023 Chinese balloon incident\n",
      "\n",
      "From January 28 to February 4, 2023, a high-altitude balloon originating from China flew across North American airspace, including Alaska, western Canada, and the contiguous United States. On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. Following a preliminary analysis of the debris in June, U.S. officials stated that the balloon carried intelligence-gathering equipment but does not appear to have sent information back to China. U.S. president Joe Biden described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment, however stated that it was \"not a major breach\", and that he also believed that the Chinese leadership was not aware of the balloon. The U.S. government said the balloon had a propeller for maneuverability.\n",
      "When the object was first spotted, the Pentagon characterized it as a surveillance balloon. The Chinese government maintained it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had been blown off course. According to U.S. officials, the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations. Analysts said that its flight path and structural characteristics were dissimilar from those of a typical weather balloon. American officials later disclosed that they had been tracking the balloon since it was launched from Hainan and its original destinations were likely Guam and Hawaii, but prevailing winds blew it off course and across North America.\n",
      "The incident increased U.S.–China tensions. The United States called the balloon's presence a violation of its sovereignty, and its Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a long-awaited diplomatic visit to Beijing. Canada summoned the Chinese ambassador in response to the incident.\n",
      "Three other high-altitude objects, over Northern Alaska (February 10), Yukon (February 11), and Lake Huron (February 11–12) respectively, were detected and subsequently shot down; a later assessment said they had no relation to China.\n",

      "=== History and development of reconnaissance balloons ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Balloons have been valued for their ability to observe the battlefield and direct artillery. Their usage peaked during World War I, after which they were increasingly replaced by airplanes. During the Cold War, the United States sent hundreds of high-altitude balloons, ostensibly for \"meteorological survey\" under Project Genetrix, over China and other Eastern Bloc countries to gain intelligence on their nuclear capabilities, drawing their protests.\n",
      "Although mostly supplanted by surveillance satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles, balloons have retained some advantages, such as a lower cost of production and deployment. By 2019, the Pentagon had invested millions in COLD STAR (Covert Long Dwell Stratospheric Architecture), a project for stealthy balloons that are now being transitioned from narcotics surveillance into military service. China recognizes the importance of catching up to foreign countries in this domain. Its military publications have highlighted the use of balloons to assess the early warning and response capabilities of enemy air defenses and to enhance China's own defense capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Past Chinese balloons and unidentified objects ====\n",
      "Suspected Chinese surveillance balloons have been detected in U.S. airspace in the past, namely over Guam, Hawaii, and Florida. One incursion occurred earlier during Joe Biden's presidency (after January 20, 2021) and three occurred during Donald Trump's presidency (2017–2021). These incursions did not persist as long as the one in 2023, and China was able to recover those balloons.\n",
      "Other pre-2023 incursions have remained unexplained and are classified by U.S. authorities as unidentified aerial phenomena. In 2022, the Office of the Director for National Intelligence said that there had been at least 171 reports of unexplained aerial phenomena in the United States, and the intelligence community has been unable to determine their precise nature. The commander of United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), General Glen VanHerck, said that U.S. failure to detect and identify all such incursions is \"a domain awareness gap that we have to figure out\". In response, the U.S. changed the sensitivity of its radar detection systems, which enabled it to detect additional UFOs.\n",
      "The U.S. Department of State said that many Chinese balloons have flown over more than forty countries and said that they have carried out surveillance linked to the Chinese military. In 2020 and 2021, similar balloons were sighted in Sendai and Hachinohe, Japan respectively, but they were not identified as of Chinese origin at the time. A similar aircraft was sighted in January 2022 over India's strategically important Andaman and Nicobar islands. In February 2022, several balloons were detected off the coast of Taiwan that the country's Ministry of National Defense said were likely used for meteorological observations for China's Eastern Theater Command. Another crashed near Taiwan in February 2023, carrying an antenna, a transmitter, and temperature and humidity sensors and was likely from China as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== U.S.–China tensions ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2023 balloon incident occurred while U.S.–China relations were at their worst in decades, following suspected incidents of Chinese espionage and amid increasing strategic competition in military and economic sectors. In 2022, the United States, along with some of its allies, imposed stringent export controls on \"foundational technologies\", such as semiconductor microprocessors, to China in order to hamper the latter's development of advanced technology and military tools. The US has also sought to maintain critical supply chains independent from China.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Balloon ===\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Size, propulsion, and payload ====\n",
      "The balloon carried an underslung payload described as a \"technology bay\" estimated to be the size of \"two or three school buses\" and was powered by sixteen solar arrays mounted on the payload. The balloon was 200 feet (61 m) tall according to U.S. General Glen D. VanHerck. AI startup Synthetaic, using image data from Planet Labs spacecraft, reported the balloon's diameter as 148 feet (45 m). USNORTHCOM and NORAD Commander, General Glen VanHerck, estimated the payload weighed more than 2,000 pounds (910 kg).\n",
      "The Chinese balloon was a superpressure balloon similar to earlier NASA designs, where the volume of the balloon is kept relatively constant in the face of changes in ambient pressure outside the balloon, and the temperature of the contained lifting gas. This allows better altitude control and much longer endurance compared to the more common variable-volume balloon design.\n",
      "National Security Council spokesman Admiral John Kirby said the craft had a propeller and could be maneuvered. U.S. officials told foreign diplomats in Beijing that the craft had rudders and propellers. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said it had \"limited self-steering capability\".\n",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense said the balloon did not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground while it remained in the air, and that shooting it down over water would be safer and increased the opportunity to study the wreckage for intelligence purposes.\n",
      "Citing a PLA procurement portal, a U.S. official said that the balloon was manufactured by a civilian Chinese defense contractor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Signals intelligence capabilities ====\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts noted that weather balloons typically are about 20 feet (6 m) wide, less than a quarter of the balloon's diameter. Those interviewed by BBC News said it was unusual for weather balloons to last as long as the one involved in the incident and that the balloon \"might have been more sophisticated than China claims\".\n",
      "Images from U-2 flybys and forensic analysis of the payload showed antennas that likely were used for collecting and transmitting signals intelligence. A publicly released U.S. State Department document, after the balloon was downed and debris collected, said that the balloon's solar arrays produced sufficient power to operate \"multiple active intelligence collection sensors\" and that the antennas on the balloon could collect and geolocate communications, including radio and mobile phone signals, but it was unknown if any specific devices were targets. Former U.S. Air Force Lt. General Charles \"Tuna\" Moore said that the surveillance technology aboard was inconsistent with meteorological missions and hypothesized that the Chinese would be interested in finding vulnerabilities and \"building a picture of our radar, weapon system and communication capabilities\".\n",
      "U.S. authorities did not name the manufacturer of the balloon but said with high confidence that the entity has \"direct commercial ties\" to the People's Liberation Army. They cited this as an example of military-civil fusion, where China encourages competition from and technology exchange with its private sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Detection ===\n",
      "\n",
      "High-altitude balloons are extremely difficult to detect. A 2005 study by the U.S. Air Force's Air University states surveillance balloons often present very small radar cross-sections, \"on the order of hundredths of a square meter, about the same as a small bird\", and essentially no infrared signature, which complicates the use of anti-aircraft weapons. A 2009 research paper by a USAF officer stated that balloons \"are inherently stealthy\" due to a tiny infrared signature at high altitude (as the balloon possesses no engines) and because of the difficulty of radar detection (as the balloons lack sharp edges and metal structures).\n",
      "The balloon's first reported sighting was on February 1, 2023, when civilians on a commercial airliner spotted it. On the same day, former Billings Gazette editor Chase Doak spotted the object above Billings, Montana, after seeing reports that the airspace around Billings was closed. He had initially assumed it was a star or a UFO. Doak contacted his friend and Billings Gazette photographer Larry Mayer, and the two photographed the balloon using telephoto lenses. Mayer also sent the images to various government agencies. After the photographs were published in the Billings Gazette and received widespread media coverage, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Canadian Department of National Defence announced on February 2 that NORAD was aware of a high-altitude surveillance balloon believed to belong to China and had been tracking it for \"several\" days. The balloon was flying at an altitude of 60,000 feet (18,000 m) over Billings at the time.\n",
      "American defense officials considered shooting the balloon down but initially decided not to due to the risk of debris injuring civilians on the ground. A meeting was convened between Secretary of Defense Austin, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley, NORTHCOM/NORAD Commander General VanHerck, and other military commanders. Biden was advised by officials not to shoot it down because debris could threaten civilians or cause property damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Flight path ===\n",
      "\n",
      "According to U.S. intelligence and retrospective analysis of satellite images, the balloon was tracked near Hainan island of China as early as January 15. It was able to change its altitude before entering the Pacific Ocean, where officials believe it was blown off-course. Retired NASA engineer Rodger Farley told the New York Times that winter winds may vary too little in direction to allow for course corrections.\n",
      "The balloon entered U.S. airspace above the Aleutian Islands on January 28, 2023, then moved across Alaska, and entered Canadian airspace over the Yukon and Northwest Territories on January 30, 2023. After flying southeast over British Columbia, the balloon re-entered the U.S. in northern Idaho on January 31 and Montana on February 1, where it was spotted over Billings. Montana is the location of multiple intercontinental ballistic missile installations, such as Malmstrom Air Force Base, causing suspicion that the balloon had been launched to surveil said nuclear installations. The U.S. ground-based intercontinental nuclear arsenal is composed of about 400 LGM-30 Minuteman III missiles deployed around Malmstrom AFB in Montana, Minot AFB in North Dakota, and Francis E. Warren AFB in Wyoming. Meteorologist Dan Satterfield calculated a possible trajectory along this path using the HYSPLIT atmospheric model, consistent with data on prevailing westerlies from China to Montana. The balloon was spotted above northwest Missouri, near Kansas City, on February 3, and subsequently passed near Whiteman Air Force Base, which houses nuclear-capable Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirits.\n",
      "According to some U.S. officials, China attempted to speed up the balloon, after its presence became known to the public, in order for it to exit U.S. airspace more quickly. Other officials reported that the balloon loitered near sensitive military sites and made multiple passes under control. Experts interviewed by Time said that the balloon traveled much farther than a typical weather balloon would and Chinese officials should not be surprised that it would eventually reach the contiguous United States or be detected. The balloon flew at an altitude of 60,000 feet (18,000 m). In comparison, business jets can reach 51,000 feet (16,000 m), commercial airliners can reach 45,000 feet (14,000 m), and the SR-71 (an American surveillance plane) had reached 90,000 feet (27,000 m).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== U.S. monitoring and counterintelligence ===\n",
      "\n",
      "During the incident, a U.S. defense official stated that the balloon had \"limited additive value from an intelligence collection perspective\". Nonetheless, the Pentagon took steps to protect its assets from leaking sensitive information to the balloon. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said the U.S. military was able to collect valuable intelligence on the balloon while it was transiting North America. Air Force General Glen VanHerck said that the U.S. Department of Defense obtained special authorization to collect intelligence against the balloon within the U.S.\n",
      "Two F-22 Raptors were scrambled from Nellis Air Force Base after the balloon was spotted on February 1. It was also monitored by crewed aircraft deployed by NORAD, including a Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS), a Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft, a U-2S Dragon Lady, and another F-22 Raptor from Langley Air Force Base. The U.S. Department of Defense said that, during the balloon's overflight of the United States, it had blocked the balloon from gathering intelligence and was able to study the balloon and its equipment. Officials told CNN that the U.S. was able to track and monitor the balloon by its signals, but it seemed to stop transmitting after the U.S. learned about its presence.\n",
      "A U.S. government official said that at least two U-2S reconnaissance aircraft were used to gather data about the balloon while it was over the Midwest, though it was not clear at which points in the balloon's flight it was tracked by U-2S aircraft. The War Zone commented that the U-2S's high flight ceiling, exceeding 70,000 feet (21,000 m), allowed it to observe the balloon from within relatively close proximity (including from above), and its electronic warfare suite allowed the aircraft to potentially jam or monitor any radio emissions from the balloon, such as data transmissions directed upwards towards Chinese communications satellites.\n",
      "In early April, unnamed U.S. officials told NBC that the balloon was able to gather electronic intelligence from the military sites it overflew and transmit it back to China. The U.S. Department of Defense could not confirm the report and reiterated that any information gathered would have \"limited additive value\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Downing ===\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 4, the balloon had drifted over the Carolinas. The Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace over the area in one of the largest temporary flight restrictions in U.S. history, \"more than five times the restricted airspace surrounding Washington, D.C., and nearly double the area of the state of Massachusetts\". A ground stop was ordered on the coast at Myrtle Beach International Airport and Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina. Military aircraft were reported to be over the Carolinas. U.S. officials later stated that this was in preparation for the eventual downing of the balloon within American territorial waters over the Atlantic Ocean.\n",
      "The balloon was shot down over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, by an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile fired from a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor that had departed from Langley Air Force Base; the downing occurred at 2:39 p.m. eastern time. The F-22 fired the missile at an altitude of 58,000 feet (18,000 m), which struck the balloon at an altitude of 60,000–65,000 feet (18–20 km). The balloon splashed down within U.S. territorial waters 6 nautical miles (11 km) off the coastline, where the water was 47 feet (14 m) deep. The downing was the first recorded by an F-22 aircraft, the first of an aircraft over U.S. territory since World War II, and is speculated to be the highest altitude air-to-air kill in recorded history.\n",

      "Debris from the balloon was dispersed over an area of 2.25 square kilometres (0.87 sq mi), where the ocean was about 47 feet (14 m) deep. A pair of F-15Cs from Barnes Air National Guard Base used Sniper targeting pods to record the downing and locations of falling debris. VanHerck said the United States Navy was conducting recovery operations while the U.S. Coast Guard was securing the region where the debris fell. Guided-missile destroyer USS Oscar Austin, guided-missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea, and dock landing ship USS Carter Hall were tasked with retrieving the balloon wreckage, alongside Coast Guard cutters and helicopters, U.S. Navy divers, and FBI counterintelligence agents. General VanHerck stated that unmanned underwater vehicles controlled from rigid inflatable boats used side-scan sonar to locate the sunken debris. The unmanned submersibles analyzed the wreckage to identify potential threats to recovery divers, such as explosives or batteries with hazardous materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 6, some of the downed payload was sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for forensic analysis by the Bureau's Operational Technology Division. Possible balloon debris was spotted later on the South Carolina coast, where police were asking residents to report other sightings. China said it wanted the wreckage returned, but the U.S. said it had no plans to do so.\n",
      "By February 13, the U.S. had recovered a significant portion of the balloon's payload, including sensors, electronics, and structural sections. The entire payload measured 30 feet (9.1 m), weighed more than 2,000 pounds (910 kg) by estimates, and contained all of the craft's equipment and antennas. Underwater recovery efforts were suspended on February 14 due to bad weather. On February 17, the U.S. military said that recovery operations have concluded for the balloon after the final debris was located and retrieved.\n",

      "== Legality of airspace and downing ==\n",
      "The United States asserts sovereignty of the airspace above its territories. Like that of other countries, this right, up to the ill-defined boundary of space, is recognized by the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation. Foreign aircraft are generally permitted to transit through U.S. airspace but must follow specific procedures and regulations. Article 8 of the convention states that aircraft flown without pilots must obtain permission from the country below and must be controlled to reduce danger.\n",
      "Before the revelation by the United States that the balloon was likely blown off course, analysts concluded that shooting it down was legal under U.S. domestic law. Its destruction under international law is murkier due to potential intervening factors such as force majeure, but characterizing it as an act of reprisal would help firm up that position. Although China protested the shootdown, Julian Ku, professor of law at Hofstra University, said that the wording of China's statement reflects that its Ministry of Foreign Affairs \"does not believe downing the balloon is a clear legal violation.\"\n",

The White House did not want to announce the balloon's incursion to protect Blinken's visit, but press and social media interest made Pentagon officials comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to questions regarding the situation, on February 4, Biden said, \"We're going to take care of it\". Later that day, U.S. officials disclosed that three days earlier he had granted permission to down the balloon.\n",
      "Pentagon officials stated that there was no earlier opportunity to shoot down over water, rebutting Trump and other Republicans who criticized the Biden administration for not shooting down the balloon earlier. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer added: \"The bottom line here is that shooting down the balloon over water wasn't just the safest option, but it was the one that maximized our intel gain.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 6, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman briefed 150 diplomats from about 40 embassies on China's balloon surveillance program, said by U.S. officials to have been operated for several years by the People's Liberation Army from Hainan on China's south coast, as part of an effort to \"name and shame\" Chinese espionage by publicizing it. Officials are communicating separately with countries where they say there have been at least two dozen such overflights since 2018, including Japan, India, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines in addition to North and South America.\n",
      "The U.S. House Armed Services Committee held a February 7 hearing on wide-ranging Chinese military and intelligence threats including the balloon incursions. Committee chair Republican Mike Rogers characterized the balloon as an intentionally calculated show of force. A U.S. official told The Washington Post there was no sense that the balloon was a deliberate provocation, as it was part of an ongoing global surveillance program. The U.S. House of Representatives voted 419–0 to adopt a resolution condemning China for the incident.\n",
      "Trump called reports of intrusions during his administration \"fake disinformation\"; and his ex-top national security officials said they were unaware of any balloon incursions during their tenure. Biden administration National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that improved airspace surveillance ordered by Biden after he took office had detected the previous incursions and \"enhanced our capacity to be able to detect things that the Trump administration was unable to detect\".\n",
      "On February 9, Biden stated that the suspected Chinese spy balloon was \"not a major breach\", and claimed that the incident was unintentional and that it was embarrassing the Chinese authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's not a major breach. Look, the total amount of intelligence gathering that's going on by every country around the world is overwhelming. China has some legitimate difficulties unrelated to the United States. And I think one of the things that balloon caused was not so much that it got shot down, but I don't think the leadership knew where it was, what was in it, and what was going on.\"-US President Joe Biden \n",
      "On February 10, the U.S. accused six Chinese companies of supporting the country's military and balloon surveillance program and added them to the U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List, which places certain restrictions on exports: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd.; China Electronics Technology Group Corporation 48th Research Institute; Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd.; Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd. (EMAST); Guangzhou Tian-Hai-Xiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd.; and Shanxi Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group Co., Ltd. Washington did not specifically link any of them to the balloon that it had shot down.\n",
      "On February 14, intelligence officials began to explore the possibility that the balloon had not been intended to penetrate U.S. airspace and transit the continental United States but that Chinese authorities had instead sought to engage in more typical surveillance activities near Guam before the balloon potentially became blown off course. These discussions suggested that the international incident caused by the balloon's cross-continental transit may have been partly the result of an accident.\n",
      "On February 16, President Biden gave his first formal remarks on the incident saying, \"We're not looking for a new Cold War, but I make no apologies, we will compete and we will responsibly manage that competition so that it doesn't veer into conflict.\" He further directed his team to develop \"sharper rules on how to address these unidentified objects in the future so that the government can distinguish between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.\"\n",
      "In March, senators Mark Kelly and Ted Budd introduced legislation to mandate tracking of high-altitude balloons.\n",

Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course.\" She said China regretted the unintentional incident, citing force majeure. On February 6, Mao said that the U.S. \"hyped up the incident on purpose and even used force to attack\", and called the shoot down \"an unacceptable and irresponsible action\".\n",
      "After the downing on February 5, Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng said he had filed a formal complaint with the U.S. Embassy in response to the incident. Xie accused the United States of indiscriminately using force against a civilian airship that was about to leave U.S. airspace. This force was in violation of \"the spirit of international law and international practice\" and said that the Chinese government reserved the right to \"take further necessary responses\". On February 6, a Chinese diplomat said in an interview with French news network LCI that the United States should return the recovered balloon debris to China.\n",
      "On February 13, Chinese Foreign Affairs spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that U.S. high-altitude balloons had \"illegally crossed China's airspace\" more than ten times since 2022. According to CNN, he did not offer evidence. Wang also complained about U.S. reconnaissance against China and wiretapping efforts around the world. U.S. National Security spokesperson John Kirby said \"there is no U.S. surveillance craft in China's airspace\" but declined to specify whether his denial covered disputed airspace claimed by China. On February 14, Wang elaborated by saying that since 2022, circumnavigation balloons launched from U.S. soil flew over China and other countries illegally more than ten times.\n",

      "Michael Clarke, a British defense analyst, claimed that China wanted the balloon \"to be noticed\". He described the incident as a \"stunt gone wrong\", giving the United States an opportunity to \"milk this\". Believing China to be \"completely in the wrong\", Clarke surmised that the fly-over was their way of retaliating for a February 2 agreement between the United States and the Philippines that would grant four more US military bases there in response to China's nine dash line claims.\n",
      "John Blaxland, a professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Australian National University, suggested that China likely expected the balloon to be detected and being detected was the goal. He believes that the balloon was launched to embarrass the US, with intelligence gathering being a secondary objective. Baxland also said that the balloon could be designed to test the resolve of Washington as well as gather information about American detection capabilities and reaction.\n",
      "On the shooting of the balloon, Christopher Twomey, a security scholar, said that any Chinese response would be restrained and that China would want to \"sweep this under the rug\" and emphasize senior-level visits within months.\n",
      "Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said that \"we collect intelligence on China from bases all around their east coast, in Japan, Guam and Australia. We fly P-8 [spy plane] flights on a daily basis and the Chinese can't do that.\" Surveillance ballons might have been a creative way to collect information and to offer China some insights into US capabilities and possibly vulnerabilities.\n",
      "Gregory Falco, an aerospace security expert at the Johns Hopkins University, said that the balloon's large solar panels and antenna indicated surveillance technology. According to Falco, the first balloon and subsequent UFOs downed by the United States are part of a hybrid communications architecture linking with Chinese satellites. He said that surveillance by balloon is conducted by many nations and detected \"all the time\" without eliciting a big response. After the balloon was seen by the public, in part because of its large size, political pressure prompted the Biden administration to make a show of force, even though trying to lower the objects' altitude more slowly might have preserved more of their payload compared with destroying them using advanced missiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Satire ====\n",
      "The incident was satirized for the show Saturday Night Live the evening after it was shot down. In the sketch, performer Bowen Yang portrayed an anthropomorphized depiction of the downed balloon being interviewed by MSNBC journalist Katy Tur (played by Chloe Fineman). Some sources paid particular attention to Yang's line, \"Congrats! You shot a balloon!\", with USA Today using it in the headline of its coverage.\n",

      "\n",
      "== Other high-altitude objects in February 2023 ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Another balloon was detected flying over Latin America. The Costa Rican General Directorate of Civil Aviation confirmed the incursion by an object \"not of Costa Rican origin\", which the locals had first seen on February 2. The Colombian Air Force said that on the morning of February 3, it had detected an object with \"characteristics similar to those of a balloon\" at a height of 55,000 feet (17,000 m) and traveling at a speed of 25 knots (46 kilometres per hour; 29 miles per hour), and after determining it was not a threat to national security and defense or to air safety, had continued to track it until it left Colombian airspace. Sightings of the balloon were also reported from Venezuela, specifically from Maracaibo. The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed those sightings and called the object another Chinese surveillance balloon. On February 6, Mao Ning, the spokeswoman for the Chinese government, confirmed the balloon belongs to China, but said that it was used for \"flight tests\" and was blown off-course in much the same manner as the one spotted over North America. VanHerck revealed on March 7 that China later took down the second balloon.\n",
      "On February 10, another high-altitude object was shot down on the vicinity of Deadhorse, Alaska, over the Beaufort Sea; recovery efforts by the Alaska National Guard on the sea ice followed.\n",
      "On February 11, on previous orders of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a \"small, cylindrical object\" was shot down over the Yukon Territory for violating Canadian air space; both U.S. and Canadian aircraft had scrambled, and a U.S. F-22 jet fighter made the kill.\n",
      "On February 12, the US military shot down a fourth unidentified object over Lake Huron, within the maritime territory of Michigan.\n",
      "On February 14, the US government announced that the latter three high-altitude objects shot down over the North America were likely private entities with no relations to China. Further analysis and debris collections were underway. The four AIM-9X missiles expended for shooting down the three objects cost at least $1.5 million.\n",

      "== Additional assessments of the balloon ==\n",
      "Following the April 2023 Pentagon document leaks, The Washington Post uncovered additional information from a trove of classified files on Discord that had previously not been reported. They include U.S. assessment of the Chinese balloon's power generation capability (up to 10,000 watts), which would be sufficient to operate synthetic-aperture radar equipment if carried on board, and how parts of the Chinese government were surprised by the balloon's North American incursion, judging from intercepted communications. U.S. intelligence had been aware of four other similar balloons, one of which had flown over a Nimitz carrier strike group in western Pacific, while another had crashed in the South China Sea. The documents did not date those incidents. The Pentagon and the Office of National Intelligence declined to comment.\n",
      "In June, preliminary investigation by the U.S. reported the presence of reconnaissance equipment on board the balloon downed in February. There were conflicting reports on whether it had collected any intelligence during its flight. It does not appear to have sent anything back to China. The Wall Street Journal said the balloon carried off-the-shelf U.S. gear. Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick S. Ryder did not confirm that information but said that Chinese drones in the past have utilized off-the-shelf U.S. equipment. He also said that mitigation efforts \"contributed\" to the balloon not collecting any intelligence while transiting or overflying the United States. \n",
      "On September 17, 2023, in an interview with CBS news, General Mark Milley, the retiring 20th US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated “I would say it was a spy balloon that we know with high degree of certainty got no intelligence, and didn't transmit any intelligence back to China.\" Technical experts had also found that the balloon's sensors had never been activated while it was travelling over the Continental United States. The general also touched on a leading theory that the reason that it was flying over the United States, was probably because it was blown off-track, where the balloon had been heading towards Hawaii however winds at 60,000 feet simply came into the equation. Milley said, \"those winds are very high.. the particular motor on that aircraft can't go against those winds at that altitude.\"\n",
      "On December 28, 2023, it was determined that the balloon utilized an undisclosed American service provider to provide data back to Beijing.\n",

      "Humanitarian relief efforts provided aid that included heating and relief funds. Foreign relief efforts were complicated by a ban on women providing humanitarian aid. These restrictions were relaxed for health-related aid on January 17, so non-governmental organizations such as the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and Care International resumed operations.

      "\n",
      "The Myanmar civil war, also called the Burmese Spring Revolution, Burmese civil war or People's Defensive War, is an ongoing civil war following Myanmar's long-running insurgencies, which escalated significantly in response to the 2021 military coup d'état and the subsequent violent crackdown on anti-coup protests. The exiled National Unity Government and major ethnic armed organisations repudiated the 2008 Constitution and called instead for a democratic federal state. Besides engaging this rebel alliance, the junta also contends with other anti-junta forces in areas under its control. Hannah Beech of The New York Times observed the insurgents are apportioned into hundreds of armed groups scattered across the country.\n",
      "As of March 2023, the United Nations (UN) estimated that since the coup in February 2021, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and over 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed. UNOCHA said that over 40,000 people had fled into neighboring countries, such as Bangladesh, India and Thailand.\n",
      "As of October 2023, Myanmar's military, the Tatmadaw, controlled under 40% of the country, although they maintained that they controlled around two thirds of the country's 330 townships. In the second half of 2023, Chinland Defense Forces in the state of Chin had captured a majority of the state, with a few holdouts in urban areas and along the India–Myanmar border remaining. In October 2023, the Tatmadaw began facing manpower issues, with desertions and low morale being extremely common. This coincided with a major rebel offensive by the People's Defence Force and Three Brotherhood Alliance in the west of the country, which was successful in taking 80 bases, 220 junta positions and several towns by 28 November 2023.\n",
      "October and November 2023 saw a series of concurrent rebel offensives, including Operation 1111 besieging the state capital of Loikaw and renewed conflict by anti-junta forces in northern Rakhine and Chin states. In Operation 1027, anti-junta forces seized Laukkai, the capital of Kokang Self-Administered Zone, in early January 2024. Operation 1027 continued past a ceasefire in northern Shan State with Mrauk U, among others, falling to Arakan Army forces in February 2024. As of February 2024, thousands of the junta's soldiers have surrendered without a fight, including six generals of the Tatmadaw. The junta used terror tactics against the population, including burnings, beheadings, mutilations, war rape, torching villages, and a massive aerial bombing campaign that has displaced nearly three million people. The Myanmar Air Force has dropped more bombs per capita than have been dropped in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A group of observers write that the Tatmadaw's forces remain \"formidable and well-equipped\", with \"external allies and economic resources\".\n",

      "=== Internal conflict in Myanmar ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Insurgencies have been ongoing in Myanmar since 1948 and have largely been ethnic-based. Communist insurgencies and the Karen National Union were the primary opposition actors to the central government. Over the 20th century, several prominent ethnic armed organisations (EAOs) rose and fell in influence and control. Larger rebel factions such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) formed in response to Ne Win's 1962 coup d'état and its increased political repression. The 8888 Uprising, in response to the totalitarian rule of Ne Win, resulted in some of the first modern Bamar militias forming from protestors heading to areas under ethnic rebel control.\n",
      "In the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising, the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), later known as the State Peace and Development Council, formed a military junta. Myanmar's military, known better as the Tatmadaw, severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds through the 1990s. By the time of the 2011–2015 Myanmar political reforms, the junta had regained control of many long-time rebel strongholds including Kokang and Karen State.\n",
      "The 2008 Constitution created self-administered zones with increased autonomy as part of its reforms. In 2015, the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed between eight EAOs and the central government. However, by 2018 the NCA began to fall apart, due to alleged violations of the agreement by Tatmadaw soldiers entering EAO territories to build roads. Many non-signatories continued the conflict. In late 2016, four non-signatories of the NCA formed the Northern Alliance, including the KIA and Arakan Army, engaged in war with the central government and other EAOs.\n",

      "=== 2021 Myanmar coup d'état and protests ===\n",
      "\n",
      "On the morning of 1 February 2021, the Tatmadaw successfully deposed the elected Myanmar government in a coup, forming a military junta. Former president Win Myint, Aung San Suu Kyi, and several other members of the National League for Democracy were detained during early morning raids and Min Aung Hlaing was placed as the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services and de facto ruler of the nation.\n",
      "The established motives behind the coup are unclear. In the leadup to the coup, the Tatmadaw claimed that the 2020 general elections had 8.6 million voter irregularities, but presented no evidence. The coup may have been a way to re-establish the military's long-reigning power over the country which ended ten years prior.\n",
      "The bloody repression of anti-coup demonstrations led to the creation of armed groups to fight the State Administration Council and the military junta. Gathered under the name of the People's Defence Force (PDF) and the orders of the National Unity Government (NUG), formed by parliamentarians in office before the coup d'état, the PDF and the NUG officially declared a \"defensive war\" against the military regime in September 2021. The ACLED estimated that as of 29 July 2022, around 23,521 people in total had been killed in the violence following the 2021 coup.\n",
      "In the months following the coup, the opposition began to coalesce around the National Unity Government, which launched an offensive against the State Administration Council (SAC) and the military junta. By 2022, the opposition controlled substantial, though sparsely populated, territory. In many villages and towns, the junta's attacks drove out tens of thousands of people. On the second anniversary of the coup, in February 2023, the chairman of the SAC, Min Aung Hlaing, admitted to losing stable control over \"more than a third\" of townships. Independent observers note the real number is likely far higher, with as few as 72 out of 330 townships remaining under the control of the Tatmadaw, the military forces aligned with the junta. However, the townships under the control of the junta still included all major population centres.\n",

      "By late March 2021, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country's many insurgent groups, elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war. The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw also proposed the formation of a \"federal armed force\" to combat the military, and in late March the Arakan Army (AA) threatened to end its ceasefire with the military should the latter \"persist in massacring civilians\".\n",
      "During late March, protesters increasingly began arming themselves with homemade weapons in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. Clashes with soldiers and IED attacks against administrative buildings and police stations became more common and protesters slowly became armed resistance.\n",
      "After about thirty years of dormancy, the People's Liberation Army (PLA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), became active again on 15 March 2021 when communist fighters crossed from China into Kachin State where the Kachin Independence Army would provide them weapons. and by August 2021, the CPB established a new armed wing to fight against the junta. Over the next two years, the PLA would grow its presence in Tanintharyi Region, where they fight alongside the PDF, claiming to have 1,000 active troops in December 2023.\n",

      "The unrest across the nation and the increased need for junta troops in previously peaceful urban areas strengthened EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army had already been on the offensive since February and seized the military's base of Alaw Bum near the town of Laiza on 25 March 2021. The next day, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) attacked a military base, killing 10 junta soldiers and taking others hostages in their first attack since the protests began. The following day saw the 2021 Kalay clashes where protestors openly used homemade weapons against soldiers for the first time, targeting security forces attacking a protest camp.\n",
      "The military junta declared that it would cease all military operations on 29 March 2021 and hold bilateral negotiations with ethnic armed groups. However, the Kachin Independence Army continued its offensives stating that the Myanmar Army had not ceased operations. Seven insurgent groups who were signatories to the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement aligned themselves with the National Unity Government (NUG), including the All Burma Student Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the Karen National Union (KNU). The Northern Alliance, comprising the Arakan Army, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, attacked a police station in Naungmon, Shan State, killing at least 10 police officers and indicating their disregard of the junta's call for a ceasefire. In response, on 11 April 2021, the junta military launched a counter-attack to recapture the Alaw Bum base using airstrikes and ground troops, but had to retreat amidst heavy casualties.\n",
      "On 26 April, the Battle of Mindat became one of the first large-scale conflicts arising from the 2021 coup. The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) began armed resistance in Mindat, Chin State and the junta declared martial law. After a soldier allegedly fired at protestors, fighting between the two sides erupted. The battle lasted four days, killing 30 junta soldiers and left Mindat abandoned as more than 10,000 people fled the area.\n",

      "On 16 April 2021, pro-democracy politician Min Ko Naing announced the formation of the National Unity Government, with members of ethnic minority groups in senior roles. As part of the announcement he said that ousted leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint would retain their positions and asked the international community to recognize their government over the junta. Throughout April, informal clashes with protestors intensified, such as in Taze when protesters fought back against soldiers with hunting rifles and firebombs on 8 April.\n",
      "The National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing, the People's Defence Force (PDF) – on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of the civil war. The PDF was formed to protect its supporters from military junta attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army. The PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw in the town of Muse on 23 May, killing at least 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In early June, fighting erupted in Myawaddy District where the military and Karen Border Guard Forces battled against a combined Karen and PDF force, leaving dozens of junta troops killed. Members of the Karenni PDF in Kayah State also captured and destroyed several Tatmadaw outposts near the state capital, Loikaw. Towards the end of May, the Tatmadaw used artillery and helicopters to strike PDF positions in Loikaw and Demoso. On 30 May, the KIA joined the PDF in a battle against junta troops in Katha Township, killing eight regime soldiers. Fighting also sprouted up in other Kachin State townships, including Putao, Hpakant and Momauk.\n",
      "While there were fewer conflict deaths between May and September, there were still many armed clashes and a spike in early June. Two dozen local officials appointed by the military were assassinated throughout the month of June with hundreds of bombings at police stations, banks and government offices. On 22 June, junta forces using armoured vehicles raided a safehouse of the PDF in Mandalay, detaining several fighters. Myanmar security forces killed at least 25 people in another raid in Tabayin. These attacks occurred in Central Myanmar, also known as Anyar, an area that had rarely seen armed violence in recent times. On 2 July, troops assaulted several villages in Sagaing Region and reportedly killed 41 civilians. The Washington Post described Myanmar was sliding toward \"bloody anarchy\".\n",

      "On 7 September 2021, the NUG declared a state of emergency across the nation and launched what they called the \"people's defensive war\" against the military junta. The declaration of war increased the number of skirmishes and clashes between PDF militias, EAOs and the military junta across the country. According to the NUG in September 2021, over 1,700 junta soldiers had been killed and 630 wounded in fighting during the preceding three months. Several major clashes took place from September to October in Chin State, Sagaing Region, Magwe Region, Kayah State and Shan State.\n",

      "By late September 2021, 8,000 residents of Thantlang town, Chin state, fled to Mizoram, India after their houses were set ablaze by the junta army. Ambushes by anti-junta forces in Shan State also killed at least 20 soldiers. On 16 November 2021, junta forces overran and captured the base camp of Kalay PDF in southwestern Sagaing Region, killing 2 fighters and capturing 9 Kalay PDF medics.\n",

      "According to analyst Matthew Arnold, the civil war's momentum passed a critical threshold by the end of the 2022 dry season where the revolutionary sentiment had grown into a broader social and armed resistance that the junta could no longer suppress. Towards the end of 2021, direct armed clashes gave way to more bombings, explosive devices and landmines. The PDF, with the strong ground support from local communities, attacked soft government targets like police stations, outposts and junta-owned businesses. Through these, the resistance became more organised as they seized weapons, got training and communicated between units through the help of the NUG and allied EAOs. According to the Karen National Union, roughly 2,200 junta soldiers and militiamen were killed in the first half of 2022.\n",

      "On 17 November 2021, dozens of junta soldiers ambushed an outpost of the Moebye PDF in Pekon Township, Shan State, forcing outnumbered PDF soldiers to retreat. At least four junta soldiers were killed during a four-day clash in Hpruso Township with the KNDF and Karenni Army.\n",
      "On 14 December, around 200 Tatmadaw troops searched the Karen National Union (KNU)-controlled town of Lay Kay Kaw Myothit near the Thai border, arresting people suspected to be activists or members of the PDF. On 20 December, Tatmadaw forces burned down nineteen houses in Kunnar, Loikaw Township after taking it from the KNDF the week before.\n",
      "On 24 December, more than 35 people were massacred when they were ambushed by junta troops outside the village of Mo So in Kayah State. Two staff members of the aid group Save the Children were among those killed. The United Nations Security Council condemned the attack and called for a \"thorough and transparent investigation\" into the incident.\n",
      "Throughout February and March 2022, the junta carried out repeated air strikes against civilian targets in villages in Shan, Kayin and Kayah States. On 17 February alone, around 20 junta soldiers and 20 resistance fighters were killed in clashes in Mobye, southern Shan State. Witnesses described soldiers systematically looting jewelry, cash, vehicles, and other valuables. Amnesty International reported these actions as Collective Punishment against the country's ethnic minorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fighting broke out in parts of Loikaw on 14 April. The number of refugees on the Thai border increased after increased combat in Kayin State. On 15 April, junta soldiers suffered at least 30 casualties after being pushed back by the KNLA at the battle for Lay Kay Kaw.\n",

      "==== Central Myanmar ====\n",
      "The Dry Zone historical heartland of Myanmar had rarely seen armed violence in the modern conflict in Myanmar since 1948 as a predominantly Buddhist and Bamar farming region. The fighting in the Anyar theater of Central Myanmar starting in 2021 changed this trajectory. Without the presence of EAOs, the Bamar PDF groups are characterized as local cells acting autonomously towards simple and directed towards the 2021 coup. In the 2021-2022 dry season, the PDFs began to work more closely together and coordinate towards larger goals. In early 2022, resistance forces were fighting in Monywa, the capital of Sagaing Region. Resistance attacks on the junta saw the junta retaliate on civilians Targeted personnel attacks increased, killing various junta personnel and destroying equipment. The PDF also suffered losses, with 12 fighters killed in a battle in Khin-U Township. Many cities saw violent clashes during 2022's Union Day. Mandalay also saw fighting, with casualties on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Northern Myanmar ====\n",
      "Throughout the 2021–2022 dry season, various groups in Northern Myanmar carried out ambushes against military outposts and convoys. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the PDF attacked convoys in Mohnyin and Hpakant townships. In October, they also partially shut down gold mining operations run by junta allies. After an ambush near Shwegu, the Tatmadaw responded with airstrikes and ground attacks against KIA bases in Hpakant and Mohnyin Townships. In early February, the KIA assaulted several military bases in Kachin and Shan States, reportedly burning one in Hpakant Township down. The junta responded by increasing airstrikes and send reinforcements to the area.\n",
      "The Chinland Defense Force (CDF) and the Chin National Army (CNA) raided and ambushed outposts and convoys in Matupi and Mindat Townships. In December, the Tatmadaw recaptured the town of Thantlang from the CDF in an offensive that destroyed over a quarter of the town's buildings.\n",
      "On 14 January 2022, units of the CNA moved into Senam village, south of Tamu, in neighboring Sagaing Region to attack a base run by the Indian-based People's Liberation Army of Manipur. After several hours of fighting, between 10-20 Manipuri rebels and 1 CNA fighter were killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Yangon and other regions ====\n",
      "During this time, there were several cases of guerilla warfare across Myanmar utilizing homemade explosives, including several accidents killing resistance fighters. On 17 June 2021, an army vehicle exploded in Tamwe Township, Yangon, allegedly killing several military personnel. On 14 December, Tatmadaw troops captured 12 suspected resistance fighters after several bombs accidentally exploded in Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon. Urban warfare became less practical, so resistance forces began targeting junta-aligned officials. According to junta-aligned sources, 367 junta-appointed officials were assassinated in targeted attacks between February 2021 and February 2022. Resistance forces also began targeting the homes of junta pilots in Yangon in response to airstrikes on civilians.\n",
      "Fighting also occurred in other Bamar-majority regions. On 31 January 2022, at least 36 junta soldiers were reportedly killed in ambushes over three days in Magwe, Sagaing and Tanintharyi regions and Chin, Shan and Kayah states.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== 2022 monsoon decrease in intensity ===\n",
      "The intensity of fighting decreased during the monsoon season. Resistance forces were advantaged by the rainfall as the junta could not carry out air strikes as easily. In June, resistance groups achieved control of 40–50% of the country. Arakan Army claimed to administer most of Rakhine State with an independent government. Chin National Front and CDF made plans to establish a new government. The KIA and the Wa State, a neutral de facto independent region of Myanmar, consolidated expanded territories. However, the Myanmar Army retained tight control of almost every city in Myanmar and most of the country's natural resources, including important jade mines. During this time, the PDF were also unable to move beyond rural guerilla tactics. Duwa Lashi La, acting president of the NUG, cited the lack of weaponry and international support as reasons for the prolonged conflict.\n",
      "On 31 May 2022, a bombing killed one person and injured nine others near the Sule Pagoda in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar. State media accused the People's Defence Force of being responsible for the attack, which the PDF denied. A July clash in Pekon Township, Shan State also killed around 40 junta soldiers and 11 PDF fighters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Massacres and executions ====\n",
      "The military deployed its time-tested counterinsurgency methods in what has been called a \"hammer approach\" of bombing and burning villages and massacring civilians to flush out rebel groups. However, the approach was ineffective because they were unable to consolidate power or deter the resistance.\n",
      "Myanmar military forces executed at least 37 villagers in the Mon Taing Pin massacre in May 2022 after shelling the village of Mondaingbin, Sagaing Region with heavy artillery. The junta forces entered the local Buddhist monastery, conscripted young male villagers briefly before executing them and other captives by a stupa.\n",
      "On 23 July 2022, the State Administration Council announced that it had executed four political prisoners, including Zayar Thaw and Kyaw Min Yu, which was the first use of capital punishment in Myanmar since the late 1980s. The men had been accused of helping the resistance movement. The event was widely seen as a provocation to escalate the ongoing conflict by the Tatmadaw. The international community, including United Nations Secretary-General, the G7 nations and the European Union strongly condemned the executions.\n",
      "According to a special report from Radio Free Asia, junta soldiers following a raid in Kachin state’s Se Zin village in August 2022, set fire to more than 400 homes with at least 15 people killed on the spot, detained some 400 people in and around Se Zin, and about 100 of them have been killed (including extrajudicial massacre) by security forces between August 2022 and January 2023 while others died due to horrific prison conditions.\n",
      "On 16 September 2022, the Burmese military killed 11 children and wounded another 17 in the Let Yet Kone massacre, as part of an airborne strike conducted against a school in Let Yet Kone, Sagaing Region. The military claimed that the village was harbouring resistance fighters from the KIA and PDF. The attack was widely condemned by the international community, including the United Nations and European Union.\n",
      "Later in September 2022, retired Brigadier General Ohn Thwin, mentor to State Administration Council vice-chairman Senior General Soe Win, was assassinated by anti-regime guerilla groups in Yangon. This assassination caused an increase in security on high-ranking junta personnel.\n",

      "In early 2022, the Arakan Army and the junta clashed again in northern Rakhine State. On 8 February, Arakan Army and junta forces clashed on at least two occasions in Maungdaw in Rakhine State. Fighting broke out on 4 February when junta troops carried out a sneak attack on an AA outpost near the Letpan Mountains northeast of Mee Taik Village, killing an AA sentry, according to AA spokesman Khaing Thukha. Three hours of clashes were also reported on 6 February. The clashes raised fears of a breakdown of the informal ceasefire between the AA and the military which had been in place since November 2020. Further clashes in northern Maungdaw on the night of 7 February killed two civilians. Several junta troops, including a major, were also killed in the attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between June and August 2022, the informal ceasefire reached in late 2020 between the Arakan Army (AA) and the junta broke down. The AA had consolidated control during this period, avoided the initial violence of the war, and introduced many public services and local administrators in northern Rakhine state. With the military's attention diverted to the increasing resistance elsewhere and increasing popular support for an alliance with the NUG, the AA sought to expand its influence into southern Rakhine. Rhetoric from AA leader Twan Mrat Naing in June grew more provocative with military spokespeople stating that the AA was inviting conflict. Armed clashes resumed in July after the junta launched an airstrike against an AA base in Kayin State, killing 6 AA soldiers. AA retaliated in Maungdaw Township and western Chin State in late July and early August. By late August, land travel to northern Rakhine required passing a series of checkpoints and all public transport ships ceased operation due to river and land blockades.\n",
      "On 16 August 2022, two mortar shells fired by the Myanmar Army landed in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, killing one man and injuring five others. Myanmar Army helicopters allegedly entered Bangladeshi air space to attack the Arakan Army and fired a shell within Bangladeshi air space. Two days later, Bangladesh summoned Myanmar ambassador Aung Kyaw Moe to strongly protest the land and airspace violations. In October 2022, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen made a statement that border bombings by Myanmar stopped after he met with the Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh, Li Jiming.\n",

      "In mid-October 2022, NUG issued a statement calling for the victory of the Spring Revolution by the end of 2023. This call to action was followed by increased fighting by the resistance forces in urban areas and in Southeastern Myanmar. This development took place in the wake of the junta torching at least 20 villages in the Sagaing and Magway Regions as part of a \"four cuts\" strategy of attacking civilians to weaken anti-regime movements. According to Sagaing-based resistance spokespeople, many victims of arson then joined the resistance. The urgency of the resistance was likely prompted by the looming elections planned by the State Administration Council. The fragmentated nature of the grassroots elements of the PDF became more organized in 2022 through the command of the NUG and from cooperation with various EAOs- especially the Kachin Independence Army (KIA).\n",
      "The Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF) claimed in January 2023 that 1,692 regime troops and 211 resistance fighters were killed since the 2021 coup, 293 civilians had been killed by the regime, and 126 displaced civilians died while fleeing their homes in Kayah and Shan states in 2022.\n",

The battle began with surprise attacks on the Asia Highway and at government offices within the town. Resistance forces looked poised to take the town, but ultimately withdrew two days later after facing junta air strikes and strategically drawing junta troops away from nearby positions. Four days later, undeterred KNLA-led forces seized a junta Light Infantry Battalion base in Kyain Seikgyi Township.\n",
      "In Shan State, clashes between PDF forces near Inle Lake and the Pa-O National Organisation (PNO) broke out after the PNO coerced villages for speedboats and militia recruits.\n",

      "In late 2022, Chin State resistance forces used drones in a week-long siege of an outpost in Falam Township, killing 74% of the junta forces stationed, but failing to take the outpost against aerial bombardments. In February 2023, CNA captured Thantlang police station and took control of the town. In Kachin State, the Shanni Nationalities Army (SNA) became more actively allied with the junta as conflict between SNA and the KIA grew. In August, the SNA and the Myanmar Army set fire to hundreds of homes in Kachin state forcing KIA withdrawal from the area.\n",
      "Chin forces also targeted convoys on roads within the state. In March 2023, combined Chin resistance consisting of CNA, CNDF, and CDFs conducted multiple ambushes on a regime convoy between Kalay, Falam and Hakha capturing and destroyed multiple armoured vehicles. The NUG awarded the combined Chin forces 400 million kyat for seizing two armoured vehicles. The following day, the groups attacked another junta convoy carrying 80 troops on the road between Matupi and Paletwa, killing over 30 junta soldiers. In April, CNDF attacked a junta base on the Kalay-Falam road near Varr, Falam Township, killing eleven regime soldiers and capturing fourteen.\n",

      "In early January 2023, PDF groups in Kani Township, Sagaing Region attacked junta supply ships, killing at least 25 soldiers. The junta increasingly used waterways for supplies, avoiding roadways in resistance-held areas. In April 2023, a combined PDF force from nearby townships seized the Tower Taing hill base Kani Township, killing 30 junta soldiers and seizing weapons.\n",
      "In early 2023, the Mandalay PDF announced their intentions to ramp up military operations. Alongside the TNLA, they engaged in a series of intense clashes with the junta forces in Nawnghkio Township near the Shan-Mandalay border, killing at least 75 junta soldiers and wounding 60 others.

      "Two days later, on 23 October, over 80 people were killed by an airstrike in Hpakant Township, Northern Myanmar, during an anniversary celebration for the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). At least 80 civilians were killed, making it the single deadliest attack on civilians since the start of the renewed civil war. The junta denied civilian casualties while the United Nations condemned the attack.\n",
      "In November 2022, the junta continued burning villages in Sagaing Region, including the home village of Cardinal Charles Maung Bo, the head of the Catholic Church in Myanmar.

      "\n",
      "In November 2022, the dry season allowed the greater use of the Myanmar Air Force to weaken resistance forces' ability to maintain strategic positions and outposts. Aerial bombardment, helicopter raids and artillery strikes typically followed skirmishes once junta ground forces sustained substantial losses and retreated. Once the entrapped forces were relieved by aerial support, they would engage in scorched earth tactics. World War Two veterans described the destruction as worse than that of the Burma campaign of World War II due to the deliberate targeting of civilian villages. The heavy use of air forces came alongside a decrease in junta's ability to fight on the ground. During the week of 21 November, repeated junta air attacks along the Sagaing-Kachin border killed 80 and disrupted supply chains between the two resistance regions. The junta's scorched earth campaign stretched across northern Myanmar, burning bases and villages they could no longer defend. Thousands of residents fled during the campaign as hundreds of homes were destroyed. In early 2023, one scorched earth push by the junta aimed to resecure the Letpadaung Copper Mine in Salingyi Township for Chinese foreign workers planning to leave for their holidays.\n",
      "On 23 February 2023, army troops launched a new military offensive in Sagaing, raiding and pillaging villages at the confluence of the Irrawaddy and Mu Rivers. During the offensive, troops from the 99th Light Infantry Division executed at least 17 villagers during the Tar Taing massacre.\n",

Arakan Army spokespeople maintained that they agreed to the ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, as opposed to international pressure. The Arakan Army did not withdraw from fortifications held at the time of the ceasefire. Junta spokespeople said that this was the first step towards a permanent ceasefire with the Arakan Army.

      "The military continued its campaign in northern Shan State against the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA). On 7 December 2022, the junta launched a ground offensive on the TNLA in the Battle of Namhsan using aerial bombs. After six days of fighting, the TNLA captured four villages from junta control, killing 70 soldiers and capturing 28. On 17 December, the junta retreated, claiming that they reached an agreement with TNLA, and that they intended to target the PDF forces and attacked the TNLA in mistake.

      "According to analysts in early 2023, the civil war was in a state of stalemate. Despite several successful engagements, there was still a significant disparity in power between the joint resistance forces and the junta. The PDF and EAOs faced resource constraints as they primarily relied on donations for funding and underground channels to acquire arms. The resistance also increasingly used coordinated drone attacks, such as on 27 August 2023, when 11 resistance groups jointly conducted drone strikes in Sagaing Township, killing 17 soldiers. \n",
      "In early April, the Kawthoolei Army (KTLA) launched an offensive on the Karen State Border Guard Force (BGF)-held Shwe Kokko in retaliation for the imprisonment and killing of the group's spokesperson by the BGF. After the reported capture of 5 BGF bases, by 8 April, the offensive began to stall. After junta/BGF counterattacks, the KTLA was forced to retreat, receiving heavy losses. Afterwards, the KNU stated that they did not approve these attacks, nor that they would accept the KTLA in their territory.\n",

Ye Khaing was allegedly providing information to the junta and detaining anti-junta activists at Myanmar's primary international airport. Urban Owls also claimed that Ye Khaing was a confidante of Steven Law, the owner of Asia World Company, which operates the airport, and is a major supporter of the regime together with the second-in-command, Senior General Soe Win.\n",
      "In late June 2023, a combined resistance force of PDF and KNLA took control of the National Highway 8 in Mon State, installing checkpoints and arresting junta personnel. Also in June, the Ye Township-based resistance group Ye Belu launched successive guerrilla attacks on the junta in June 2023. On 22 June, they attacked a junta security checkpoint at Chaung Taung bridge, killing four soldiers and one official working for the junta's Ministry of Immigration and Population in Lamaing. On 26 June, the group assassinated a Pyusawhti militia leader in Duya, Ye Township. Two days later, they ambushed an army convoy from the junta's No. 19 Military Operations Command, killing five soldiers and injuring others. The attacks caused a breakdown in junta administration in Ye Township. All administration offices in three towns - namely, Lamaing, Khawzar and Ye - closed down.\n",

The rebel forces aimed to capture the 606th Light Infantry Division Headquarters. On 15 September 2023, members of the Northern Thandaung Defence Force, along with the Lethal Prop drone unit, attacked the Aye Lar military base near the Nay Pyi Taw International Airport with 2 makeshift bombs. It was the first documented drone attack by resistance forces against an airbase.\n",
      "On 31 August and 9 September, the Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA) raided 2 Chinland Defense Force (CDF) outposts in Tonzang Township, killing 2 CDF soldiers.

The KNPLF began attacking Burmese military positions, joining forces with KA, KNDF, KNLA, and PDF, and seizing junta outposts in the Battle of Mese. The combined forces took over Mese Township in Eastern Kayah State. 430 soldiers of the Light Infantry Battalion, including their lieutenant colonel commander, surrendered to the resistance.

The junta sent two helicopter gunships alongside naval support to fire back, including at civilian housing, with heavy machine gun fire. Pauktaw's proximity to the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, posed a threat to the junta. Junta forces detained about 100 residents who were unable to flee, and positioned themselves to surround the town, using two navy ships to blockade the harbour.\n",

MNDAA forces attacked junta bases around the city in early December, including the Four Buddhist Statues Hill outpost immediately south of Laukkai. On 26 December, over 90 of the junta's 55th Light Infantry Division surrendered to the MNDAA. The artillery shelling of Laukkai stopped and the city mostly fell under MNDAA control on 28 December.

      "In the wake of these gains and the fall of Laukkai, on 12 January, China announced that it had negotiated another ceasefire between the junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance, known as the \"Haigeng Agreement\". The two sides agreed to disengage personnel and pledged not to compromise the safety of Chinese border residents. According to the Brotherhood Alliance, they had agreed not to seize more towns in northern Shan and that the junta had agreed not to shell or strike that area.

In Mese Township (part of Kayah State), the KNPLF, KA and KNDF launched a joint military operation called Operation 1107 that captured several border posts starting on November 7. Four days later, they launched the major Operation 1111 against Loikaw, the capital of Kayah State. The military operations in Kayah displaced tens of thousands of civilians, especially from Loikaw. After over a month of heavy fighting, rebel forces had won control of 85% of the capital. Nonetheless, fighting has continued into January. By late January, however, the offensive on Loikaw had mostly stalled.\n",

      "On 20 March, the KNLA and its PDF allies began to besiege the town of Papun, the capital of Hpapun District. Eight days later, the town was captured, with fighting moving to the hills outside the town. \n",
      "After a prolonged siege and several days of negotiations, on 5 April over 600 junta soldiers and their families stationed in Myawaddy agreed to surrender to the KNU and withdrew across the border to Mae Sot, leaving only the 275th Light Infantry Battalion (LIB), positioned near the town's western entrance, to defend the town. KNLA and PDF troops were seen at the Thai–Myanmar Friendship Bridge border crossing in northeastern Myawaddy on the morning of the 9 April. Later that afternoon, the KNLA and PDF launched a heavy assault on the LIB 275th base. Fighting ended late the next day, when the KNLA and PDF captured the LIB 275th base, forcing over 200 junta soldiers to withdraw under the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the border. In response, Thailand deployed the 3rd Army along the border. The junta began sending reinforcements in a counteroffensive to retake the town, but were stalled in Kyondoe. On 12 April, Thai officials and the KNU spokesperson confirmed the capture of Myawaddy, with the KNU stating it was preparing to establish its own administration in the town. The junta retaliated with airstrikes despite locals stating that the KNLA were not in the streets of the town.\n",
      "Despite the KNLA's major role in capturing Myawaddy, the KNLA and PDF groups ceded the city's control to the Karen National Army (KNA), KNU/KNLA Peace Council (KNU/KNLA-PC), and the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA-5) to ensure security within the city. According to the KNU/KNLA-PC, the KNA was playing a major role in negotiations between the KNU and the junta regarding Myawaddy.\n",
      "After Myawaddy's capture, the Light Infantry Division (LID) 55, numbering around 1,000 and reportedly led by the junta second-in-command Soe Win, began attempting to cross the Dawna Range to recapture the town in a counteroffensive known as \"Operation Aung Zeya\". Early in the counteroffensive, KNLA forces withdrew from Kawkareik. The LID 55 was continually intercepted by the KNLA and allies, being forced to retreat and reportedly experiencing heavy losses. Late on 19 April, the KNLA began launching attacks on the remaining 150 junta soldiers from the LIB 275th which retreated under the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on 10 April, the last junta hold-out in the town. The junta responded with airstrikes, killing several civilians and forcing the KNLA to delay their attacks on the LIB 275th. On 21 April, a junta convoy participating in Operation Aung Zeya was routed in Kawkareik Township after a resistance ambush, allowing the KNLA to capture several military vehicles. Despite this, Kawkareik town was entirely recaptured from Karen forces the next day. On 23 April, junta forces from the LIB 275th, which had been sheltering under the 2nd Friendship Bridge, were assisted by the Karen National Army in reoccupying their base outside Myawaddy. The next day, the KNU spokesmen stated that they would \"temporarily withdraw\" from Myawaddy, but stated that the KNLA would continue guerrilla attacks on junta positions along the AH1.\n",
      "After being trapped in Kawkareik Township for several weeks due to resistance ambushes and attacks, the 1,000 men reinforcements sent by the junta to aid forces in Myawaddy in Operation Aung Zeya began advancing through the Dawna Range, reaching the Taw Naw waterfall by 29 April.\n",

      "=== Mon and Karenni resistance ===\n",
      "\n",
      "After Operation 1027, Karenni resistance continued with Operation 1107 and Operation 1111 to capture Kayah State and its capital Loikaw. On 7 January, joint Karenni forces launched an offensive to capture Pekon in neighboring Shan State, capturing most of the town and township by 12 January. On 29 January, the Karenni Nationalities Defense Force (KNDF) captured the town of Mawchi. On 14 February, combined forces of the Karenni Army (KA) and KNDF captured the town of Shadaw after almost a month-long battle. This capture made Shadaw Township the second Kayah township completely captured by Karenni forces, after Mese. By 5 March, Karenni forces captured the Hpasawng Bridge. After this capture, junta jets attacked a monastery in the town, killing five and wounding 20 internally displaced people (IDP). Later, on 14 March, Karenni forces captured the rest of Hpasawng and most of Hpasawng Township. In a joint statement on 23 March, the KNDF and allies announced that they were in control of nearly 90% of Kayah State. They further stated that they had captured 65 junta positions throughout the state, and six out of nine towns in Kayah (excluding Moebye in Southern Shan State). On 10 April, the Karenni National Solidarity Organisation (KNSO), a \"people's militia force\" under the junta, declared war on the junta and joined resistance groups after an over 20-year ceasefire.\n",
      "On 20 January, local resistance forces in Ye Township began intensifying attacks around the township, announcing their intent to capture Ye. On 14 February 2024, the Mon National Liberation Army (Anti-Military Dictatorship) (MNLA-AMD) split from the Mon National Liberation Army (a signatory of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement) and effectively declared war on the junta. The splinter group's leadership, made up of senior MNLA officials, stated that they would only be active in areas the MNLA was not and intended to unite with local resistance forces. Around 22 March, several Mon State-based resistance groups, began vehicle inspections along the road stretching from the Malwe Mountain to Kaleinaung, prompting junta forces to close the road. On 25 March, the MNLA-AMD, alongside the KNLA and several allies, captured the Kawt Bein Police Station in Kawkareik Township, Karen State. In response, junta forces shelled Kawt Bein and surrounding settlements. 2 days later, Mon resistance captured nearby Dhamma Tha village.\n",
      "On 8 April, Mon PDF forces launched drone attacks on the Southeastern Command headquarters in Mawlamyine while Soe Win, deputy commander-in-chief of the junta, was in the building. Whether Soe Win was affected remains unknown. On 19 April, the MNLA-AMD began launching attacks on a junta convoy in Kyaikmaraw Township heading towards Myawaddy to recapture the city from anti-junta forces. On 25 April, after a day long battle involving around 300 junta troops, junta forces recaptured the town of Kawt Bein and Dhamma Tha from Mon resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Drone attack on Naypyidaw ===\n",
      "On 4 April 2024, the People's Defense Force launched an unprecedented drone attack against Aye Lar airbase, the main Tatmadaw headquarters, and Min Aung Hlaing's residence in the capital, Naypyidaw. Almost 30 drones were deployed; junta forces claimed 7 were shot down. Myawaddy TV said 13 fixed-wing drones were shot down and there were no casualties or damage to property. NUG claimed the attack was \"a success\". On 12 April, local People's Defense Forces claimed that they killed over a dozen junta soldiers in another attack on Aye Lar Airbase.\n",

      "== Humanitarian impact and war crimes ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The human rights situation in Myanmar has deteriorated substantially since the beginning of the civil conflict. The Burmese military has escalated its use of war crimes, including murder, mass killings, sexual violence, torture, arbitrary detention, attacks on religious buildings, and the targeting of civilians. The junta has also seized the properties of political opponents as part of an intimidation strategy, impacting hundreds of families. BBC News reports that the pro-junta paramilitary Pyusawhti militias have been accused of more than one atrocity against civilians.\n",
      "Since the onset of the civil conflict, both the Burmese military and resistance forces alike have used educational facilities as bases and detention sites. In 2021, over 190 violent attacks on schools were reported in 13 of Myanmar's states and regions. As of June 2022, 7.8 million children remained out of school.\n",
      "Myanmar's public health system has effectively collapsed, and the civil war has worsened the country's food security crisis, with one in four people experiencing food insecurity. Poverty and food insecurity have disproportionately affected Myanmar's Dry Zone and the Irrawaddy delta regions, which account for over 80% of the country's agricultural area and are home to a third of the country's population.\n",
      "As of September 2022, 1.3 million people had been internally displaced, and over 13,000 children had been killed. By March 2023, the UN estimated that since the coup, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed.\n",
      "In March 2023, Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, reported that armed conflict had continued to grow. He stated that they were investigating hundreds of incidents of houses being burnt and civilians, including children, being killed. Overall, 15.2 million people faced food insecurity.\n",
      "In March 2024, Tom Andrews, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar, stated that 18.6 million people were in need of humanitarian aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Economic impact ==\n",
      "Economic conditions in Myanmar have substantially worsened due to the ongoing war and to economic mismanagement by the SAC. In 2021, Myanmar's GDP declined by 5.9%. In an interview, Christian Lechervy, the French ambassador to Myanmar, highlighted the impact of the coup on the country's economy: \"In 2021, Myanmar's economic growth has contracted by more than 18%, poverty has doubled, the number of people in need of humanitarian aid has multiplied by seven and more than 450,000 people have been forced to flee their homes\". Between March and June 2022, almost 10,000 people per month left the country through official channels, worsening the country's brain drain and mirroring the civilian exodus that followed the 1962 and 1988 military coups. The local job market has collapsed. \n",
      "In September 2022, the G7-led Financial Action Task Force announced plans to blacklist Myanmar for failing to stem money laundering and terrorist financing. At that time, only Iran and North Korea were on the Financial Action Task Force blacklist. In October 2022, Myanmar was blacklisted by the task force, which increased volatility in the value of the Burmese kyat.\n",
      "The war disrupted transport and stunted the export of agricultural goods like rice and corn, and the illegal cultivation of poppy became an economic pillar for many Burmese. Myanmar became the world’s biggest opium producer, producing about 1,080 metric tons in 2023.\n",
      "During the war, there has been a \"mass refusal\" among Myanmar's people to pay taxes and other charges to the junta, leading to a 33% drop in state revenue according to an analysis by the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar (SAC-M). According to the SAC-M, \"69% of businesses reported not paying tax to the junta in the first three months of 2022\". The cessation of payments of electricity bills by large portions of the population has also significantly cut off the junta's revenue sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Hyperinflation ===\n",
      "\n",
      "As of September 2022, the value of the Burmese kyat has depreciated by over 60%, while basic commodity prices have increased by up to 57%. The World Bank estimated Myanmar's economy contracted by another 18% in 2022. Since April 2022, the country has experienced foreign currency shortages, which have acutely impacted importers, resulting in shortages of basic products like medicines and fertilisers. The military regime has imposed foreign currency controls, which has worsened the shortage of US dollars among international firms operating in the country. Many foreign and multinational companies, including Telenor, Ooredoo, Chevron, British American Tobacco, and Woodside Petroleum have exited the Burmese market as the conflict has intensified.\n",
      "At the end of July 2023, the SAC announced that it would issue a limited number of new 20,000 kyat banknotes. The announcement led to an increase in the price of gold, as well as in foreign currency exchange rates. In early 2024, it was reported that the civil war had significantly increased prices of every day goods, such as rice (160–220%), fuel (520%), and palm oil (75%) from pre-war levels. Also, the US dollar to Kyat exchange rate had increased by 160%. In April 2024, the price of gold was around 4.5 million kyat per kyattha (a Burmese unit of mass) compared to 1 million per kyattha in February 2021. The SAC regularly accuses goldsmiths of price manipulation when gold prices rise. An arrest of five traders and closure of seven shops, caused the price to drop in early April 2024 as traders were fearful of doing business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Interim Central Bank (ICB) ===\n",
      "The National Unity Government of Myanmar established an Interim Central Bank (ICB) led by their Planning, Finance and Investment minister, Tin Tun Naing. The goal of establishing this bank is to contest foreign reserves and assets held by the Central Bank in Naypitaw. It was also reported that the ICB seized 44 billion Kyats from other banks. Radio Free Asia explained in regards to Central Banks raising funds for their government; \"The NUG has acknowledged raising over $150 million since the coup\" and that while \"it dwarfs in comparison to the revenue of the junta, which gave itself a raise of 51 percent in FY2023 to $2.7 billion—it's not insignificant either.\"\n",
      "Under the direction of the ICB there is a newly established for-profit bank called Spring Development Bank, with an intent to establish its own cryptocurrency.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Environmental impact ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The deterioration in law and order in many parts of Myanmar has caused \"a surge in illegal mining activities\" in rural parts of the country. Environmental activists in Myanmar have accused the junta of supporting illegal mining of rare-earth elements which have \"devastating and unpredictable consequences for the region’s ecosystem and inhabitants\". Rivers have been contaminated, causing the destruction of local ecosystems, decreasing community access to clean water and disrupting agricultural activities of local farmers. The junta has cracked down on environmental activists who have criticized the government. The conflict has also seen a significant rise in deforestation in Myanmar.\n",

      "=== Tatmadaw and allies ===\n",
      "\n",
      "A February 2022 report by United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar Tom Andrews stated that China, Russia, India, Belarus, Ukraine, Israel, Serbia, Pakistan and South Korea were selling the weapons to the junta. The Karen National Union documented the use of North Korean weaponry by the junta in November 2023.\n",
      "Anti-junta forces have claimed that the Tatmadaw has severely struggled with recruitment and morale.\n",
      "On 31 January 2023, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued a directive enabling organisations and citizens deemed \"loyal to the state,\" including civilians, civil servants, and army personnel, to obtain firearms licenses. The regulatory shift has enabled the military junta to arm pro-junta Pyusawhti militias and to suppress pro-democracy forces in light of waning military recruitment and their challenges with concurrently operating in multiple war theatres throughout the country. On 12 February 2023, a leaked document purportedly from the Ministry of Home Affairs detailed the junta issuing firearms licenses to pro-regime civilians for the operation of counter-insurgency paramilitaries based on the new firearm licensing directive.\n",
      "Junta-aligned Pyusawhti militias have reportedly used force to recruit local men, but have been less than effective in building up grassroots enforcement on behalf of the junta, and have \"taken root only in the small number of communities where the military's own party is traditionally strong.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One man contacted by the BBC in the area where Wathawa has been mobilising since early 2022 said he had only been able to recruit a maximum of 10–15 men in each village, and then only by threatening to burn down their homes.  He said many of the recruits had run away, and were being helped by other villagers to hide from Wathawa and his gun-toting monks.\n",
      "In early December 2023, the Tatmadaw-led government appealed for deserters to return, promising the deserters exoneration. The National Unity Government claims some 20,000 soldiers had deserted and joined its ranks. By 7 December, the junta began freeing soldiers who had been jailed for desertion to ease apparent manpower shortages as a result of battlefield pressures from recent operations.\n",
      "On 10 February 2024, the Tatmadaw announced the People's Military Service Law, requring all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 to complete up to two years of mandatory military service, amid its territorial losses. Those who fail to enlist face imprisonment for up to five years during a national emergency. This announcement has been interpreted by some as a sign of increasing desperation in the face of steadily advancing resistance forces. In the wake of the announcement, Deutsche Welle also reported that \"thousands\" of young people were fleeing across the border to Thailand to evade conscription before it came into effect. Local Myanmar government officials are reportedly extorting bribes from those seeking to avoid being conscripted. 21 administrators in Rakhine's Thandwe announced their resignation in response to the military recruitment. Rebel groups killed at least 37 local officials carrying out the junta's conscription efforts.\n",
      "Activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi thought the military’s historic \"indoctrination techniques are deeply rooted in nationalism and religious ideologies\" leaving \"soldiers and their families feeling disoriented amidst shifting societal paradigms\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Anti-junta forces ===\n",
      "The limited possession of guns by ethnic insurgent movements along with the lack of international support and formal means of acquiring military material has presented the anti-junta forces with a challenging situation for the confrontation of the military regime. Faced with this difficulty since the early stages of armed insurgency, the resistance movement sought ways to manufacture the necessary weapons and equipment for the conflict. Initially, the rebels expanded the production of a traditionally made, single-shot rifle known as Tumi, especially in the Chin state. Nonetheless, this kind of rifle is severely limited for battleground action. For this reason, the fighters have developed alternative models which are more advanced, while still calling them Tumi. Since then, the resistance movement has developed many kinds of carbines, landmines and bomb drones, to be manufactured within the technological and material means of liberated territories and underground cells.\n",
      "Commercially available drones rigged to carry bombs were used to attack military positions. PDF groups reportedly produced naval bombs to target government logistics in rivers. Meanwhile, defected soldiers developed 60 mm long-range mortars. The use of 3D printing was also reported, both to salvage weapons taken from the junta and for the improvised production of semiautomatic carbines. An arms trafficker in possession of nuclear materials was found working with an unnamed insurgent ethnic armed group in Myanmar. The success of Operation 1027 enabled the Brotherhood Alliance to seize enormous caches of arms and ammunition from the Tatmadaw, making it better equipped than before it launched Operation 1027.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Foreign involvement ==\n",
      "\n",
      "In June 2021, the United Nations General Assembly passed a non-binding resolution asking member states to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar. Two hundred international organisations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have continued to press the UN and its member states to adopt a global arms embargo. The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union have, in response to the ongoing violence, sanctioned individuals and organisations associated with the Burmese military. However, the effectiveness of these sanctions has been undermined by poor coordination among governments and the lack of sanctions against high-impact targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASEAN blocked Myanmar from participating in regional summits after the 2021 coup. but this was reversed after New Zealand invited the junta to two ASEAN summits hosted in Wellington in April 2024. ASEAN member states have not taken a consistent, coordinated approach with respect to the ongoing civil war, due to internal divisions. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are strongly opposed to the military junta, but Thailand was a key ally of the junta until the election of Srettha Thavisin as prime minister.\n",
      "India, which represents Myanmar's fourth-largest export market and fifth-largest import partner, has continued a business-as-usual approach to cross-border relations and continues to recognize the military junta. State-owned and private Indian companies supply arms and raw materials to the junta. \n",
      "Bangladesh recognizes the military junta, but does not support its actions, in part because the Rohingya genocide has led to around 1 million Rohingya refugees fleeing to Bangladesh. Its position in the conflict has been informed by repeated spillover of the conflict into its territory.\n",
      "As of December 2023, East Timor remains the only government to have openly expressed sympathies to the anti-regime forces in Myanmar. In August 2023, the State Administration Council expelled the East Timorese ambassador in retaliation for the East Timorese government meeting with the NUG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the coup d'état, China and Russia have supported the military junta and have been its main arms suppliers. China is Myanmar's largest trading partner. The two countries have blocked any substantive action against Myanmar's military at the United Nations Security Council, while Myanmar's security forces have reportedly used Chinese and Russian-supplied weapons to perpetrate human rights violations. Chinese support for the junta has led to a rise in popular anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar. However, the fact that the Three Brotherhood Alliance's Operation 1027 in late 2023 was carried out near the China–Myanmar border may indicate a shift in China's stance, which was attributed by analysts to concerns about cyber-scam centers, the pursuit of favorable concessions from the junta on the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, and the opportunity to influence the PDF in light of evolving dynamics between NUG and EAO groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia has embraced deeper ties with the Burmese military junta as the civil war has progressed. Russia has provided materiel, military training for over 50 Myanmar Air Force pilots, and diplomatic backing to the regime. Min Aung Hlaing has visited Russia several times, personally meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in September 2022. The military junta backed the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia was among the few countries to send a congratulatory message to the junta on Myanmar's Independence Day. In March 2024, Tom Andrews saw Russia still being the number one source of weapons for the junta.\n",

      "Wagner Group rebellion\n",
      "\n",
      "On 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, engaged in a major uprising against the Government of Russia. It marked the climax of the Wagner Group–Ministry of Defense conflict, which had begun about six months earlier. Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had been leading Wagner Group activities in Ukraine, stood down after reaching an agreement a day later.\n",
      "Amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Prigozhin had come to publicly express his resentment towards Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov; he frequently blamed both men for Russia's military inadequacies, especially during the Wagner-led Battle of Bakhmut, and accused them of handing over \"Russian territories\" to the Ukrainians. He portrayed the Wagner Group's rebellion as his response to the Russian Armed Forces allegedly attacking and killing hundreds of his Wagner mercenaries, which the Russian government denied. Characterizing it as a \"march of justice\" against the Russian military establishment, he demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be removed from their positions, and eventually stated that Russia's justification for attacking Ukraine was a lie. In the early morning of 24 June, President of Russia Vladimir Putin appeared in a televised address to denounce the Wagner Group's actions as treason before pledging to quell their uprising.\n",
      "Wagner mercenaries first seized Rostov-on-Don, where the Southern Military District is headquartered, while an armored column of theirs advanced through Voronezh Oblast and towards Moscow. Armed with mobile anti-aircraft systems, they repelled the Russian military's aerial attacks, which ultimately failed to deter the Wagner column's progress. Ground defenses were concentrated on the approach to Moscow, but before Wagner Group could reach them, President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko brokered a settlement with Prigozhin, who subsequently agreed to halt the rebellion. In the late evening of 24 June, Wagner troops abandoned their push to Moscow and those who remained in Rostov-on-Don began withdrawing.\n",
      "In accordance with Lukashenko's agreement, Russia's Federal Security Service, which had initiated a case to prosecute the Wagner Group for armed rebellion against the Russian state under Article 279 of the Criminal Code, dropped all charges against Prigozhin and his Wagner fighters on 27 June. By the end of the hostilities, at least thirteen Russian soldiers had been killed and several Wagner mercenaries had been injured; Prigozhin stated that two defectors from the Russian military had been killed on Wagner Group's side as well. On 23 August 2023, exactly two months after the Wagner Group rebellion, Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash alongside other senior Wagner officials.\n",

      "\n",
      "In the early 1990s, Prigozhin, having served a decade in prison before embarking on an entrepreneurial career, emerged as a prominent figure in Saint Petersburg's business life, gaining recognition for a string of highly regarded restaurants. This connection facilitated a financial association with Putin, who was actively engaged in municipal politics during that period. Prigozhin gradually evolved into a trusted and intimate confidant of Putin, forging a close personal bond.\n",
      "In 2014, Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company. Despite the legal prohibition of private military companies in Russia, Wagner operated unimpeded with implicit endorsement and funding from the Russian government. Many analysts have said the government employed Wagner services to allow for plausible deniability and obscure the actual toll in terms of casualties and financial costs of Russia's foreign interventions.\n",
      "Serving as a tool of Russian foreign and military policy, Wagner emerged as a formidable combat force in various regions, including the Donbas conflict. It played a significant role during Russia's military intervention in the Syrian civil war, providing support to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and has participated in conflicts in Mali, Libya, and the Central African Republic. Wagner has garnered infamy due to its ruthless methods and participation in war crimes throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Ukraine, perpetrating atrocities with impunity.\n",
      "The group maintains close ties with multiple African governments, enjoying considerable autonomy to exploit the natural resources of these nations in return for supporting local forces in their battle against anti-government rebels. Wagner's economic endeavors in Africa witnessed an upward trajectory even amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as the funds generated were channeled towards financing the conflicts in Ukraine and other regions.\n",

      "In mid-June 2023, the MoD ordered Wagner to sign contracts with the military before 1 July. This move effectively integrated Wagner as a subordinate unit within the regular command structure, thereby diminishing the influence of Prigozhin. However, Prigozhin declined to sign the agreement, alleging incompetence on the part of Shoigu. Reports from the independent Russian news outlet Meduza indicated that this development would undermine Prigozhin's hold over Wagner and jeopardize the group's profitable operations in Africa. Prigozhin unsuccessfully attempted to circumvent the order for Wagner's subordination while intensifying his criticism of the MoD. He went as far as advocating for the execution of Shoigu and hinting at a potential popular uprising against inept officials. Prigozhin believed that Putin would ultimately side with him in his struggle against the MoD if he launched a mutiny.\n",

      "=== Planning the rebellion ===\n",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies observed a gradual accumulation of Wagner forces near the Russian border along with evidence of Wagner stockpiling equipment and resources in preparation for the rebellion. Although they obtained information regarding the where and how of the planned rebellion, the exact timing remained unknown. Western intelligence agencies reportedly uncovered the plan through communications intercepts and satellite image analysis. Several weeks prior to the actual event, U.S. intelligence started foreseeing a significant Wagner insurrection and obtained solid evidence of the imminent rebellion before 21 June. Prigozhin seemed to have set the plan in motion following the MoD decision on 10 June, which would effectively integrate Wagner forces into the regular military. The foreign intelligence findings indicate that the revolt was planned in advance, contradicting Prigozhin's claim that the decision to rebel was made on 23 June.\n",
      "Anonymous U.S. officials later disclosed to The New York Times that Army General Sergey Surovikin had prior knowledge of the planned rebellion. Surovikin had acted as an intermediary between Prigozhin and the military hierarchy and was perceived to have close ties to Prigozhin. CNN obtained documents that indicated Surovikin had a personal registration number with Wagner and held a covert VIP membership within the group, alongside at least 30 other high-ranking Russian military and intelligence officials. Additionally, there were indications that other generals may have lent their support to the uprising. U.S. officials asserted that Prigozhin would not have instigated the rebellion unless he harbored the belief that he had backing from specific sectors within the Russian power structure.\n",
      "According to disclosures by Western officials to the The Wall Street Journal, the Russian Federal Security Service discovered the plan two days before it was scheduled to be executed. The discovery of the plan led to the premature start of the rebellion. Prigozhin intended to capture Defense Minister Shoigu and chief of general staff Gerasimov during their planned joint visit to the southern region of Russia that borders Ukraine and Western officials said the plan had a good chance of success had it not been discovered, leading Prigozhin to improvise an alternative plan. Western officials said intelligence findings indicated that Prigozhin's plan rested on his belief that a part of the armed forces would join the rebellion, and that they believed Prigozhin had informed some senior military offices about his plan. Commander of the Russian National Guard Viktor Zolotov has claimed that Russian authorities learned about the planned rebellion and that it would be executed between 22 and 25 June. According to anonymous accounts conveyed by Meduza, it's possible that the security services \"didn't have the nerve to tell the president that something's up with Prigozhin [...] because if they reported the problem, decisions would have to be made. And how would you make that decision?\" According to Meduza's sources, after Prigozhin failed to evade the order to integrate Wagner into the regular military, \"Some bad foreboding spread in the air, that something was about to happen.\" Kremlin officials \"talked about it in meetings, and came to the conclusion that [Prigozhin] is a daring opportunist who doesn't play by the rules. When it came to the risk of an armed insurrection, they thought it was nil.\" Consequently, they believed Prigozhin's announcement of an uprising to be a bluff intended to extract concessions, only realizing the seriousness of the situation once Wagner captured Rostov-on-Don. Lukashenko has said that both he and Putin had \"slept through this situation\" and that both \"thought it would fizzle out on its own [when it started to develop]\".\n",
      "The Moscow Times reported that hours before his announcement of the rebellion, Prigozhin was secretly planning to attend a roundtable discussion in the State Duma opened by A Just Russia – For Truth leader Sergei Mironov in which MPs criticized the Kremlin's handling of the war effort in Ukraine. It added that Prigozhin was supposed to give a harsh criticism of the Russian military leadership from the Duma's chamber in a final attempt to win back Putin's approval. However, his plans were canceled at the last minute without explanation.\n",

      "\n",
      "==== Rebukes of the government and allegation of an attack on Wagner ====\n",
      "In a video released on 23 June 2023, Prigozhin claimed that the government's justifications for invading Ukraine were based on falsehoods, and that the invasion was designed to further the interests of Russian elites. He accused the MoD of attempting to deceive the public and the president by portraying Ukraine as an aggressive and hostile adversary which, in collaboration with NATO, was plotting an attack on Russian interests. Specifically, he denied that any Ukrainian escalation took place prior to 24 February 2022, which was one of the central points of Russian justification for the war. Prigozhin alleged that Shoigu and the \"oligarchic clan\" had personal motives for initiating the war. Furthermore, he asserted that the Russian military command intentionally concealed the true number of soldiers killed in Ukraine, with casualties reaching up to 1,000 on certain days.\n",
      "In an effort to create a pretext for rebellion, later on 23 June, Prigozhin amplified a video that had already been circulating in Wagner-associated Telegram channels that reportedly showed the aftermath of a missile strike on a Wagner rear camp. Prigozhin accused the Russian MoD of conducting the strike, which he claimed killed 2,000 of his fighters. The MoD denied the allegations of attacking Wagner's rear camps, and the Institute for the Study of War was unable to confirm the veracity of the video, noting that it \"may have been manufactured for informational purposes\".\n",
      "Other observers have also questioned the veracity of the video: Meduza, in its 24 June investigation, claimed that the video of the missile attack on the Wagner camp was staged, citing the unusual behavior of the men filming and inconsistencies in the footage with what the aftermath of a large explosion would look like. Georgy Aleksandrov, a war correspondent for Novaya Gazeta Europe, also thought that the video of the aftermath of the shelling did not look credible, noting \"There are no obvious craters from the hits. No obvious body fragments. No general smoke. The fires don't look like remnants from rocket impacts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Call to rebellion ====\n",
      "Prigozhin declared the start of an armed conflict against the Ministry of Defence in a message posted on his press service's Telegram channel. He called upon individuals interested in joining the conflict against the Ministry, portraying the rebellion as a response to the alleged strike on his men. Additionally, Prigozhin claimed that Shoigu had cowardly fled from Rostov-on-Don at nine o'clock in the evening. Consequently, the Federal Security Service initiated legal proceedings against Prigozhin under Article 279 of the Criminal Code, which concerns armed rebellion.\n",
      "Many members of Wagner were not informed about the planned rebellion beforehand. As a result, they were perplexed by Prigozhin's call to arms and uncertain as to which faction they should align themselves with. Demobilized Wagner veterans were instructed to remain on standby and await orders from Prigozhin. Individuals in Moscow without any affiliation with Wagner reported receiving calls, seemingly from the Wagner Group, urging them to join a rally in support of the rebellion. Similar calls were made to residents of Rostov-on-Don, soliciting support for the uprising.\n",
      "Surovikin and Lieutenant General Vladimir Alekseyev appealed to the Wagner mercenaries, urging them to cease hostilities. Surovikin made his remarks in what the Financial Times described as a \"hostage-style video\" and had, as of 29 June, remained unaccounted for. State-run Channel One Russia broadcast an \"emergency newscast,\" during which host Ekaterina Andreeva declared that Prigozhin's statements regarding alleged attacks by regular military forces on Wagner positions were false. Andreeva also mentioned that Putin had been briefed on the ongoing situation. In response to Prigozhin's statements, the country's military and National Guard deployed armored vehicles in both Moscow and Rostov-on-Don. Rostov-on-Don is near the frontlines in Ukraine where Wagner troops had been operating, and is also where Prigozhin had claimed that Wagner troops were headed. It is directly connected to Moscow by the M4 highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Capture of Rostov-on-Don ===\n",
      "During the early morning of 24 June, Wagner forces crossed into Russia's Rostov Oblast from Luhansk and swiftly captured Rostov-on-Don, encountering no apparent opposition. They successfully took control of the Southern Military District headquarters, establishing a secure perimeter in the adjacent streets. Notably, Prigozhin, captured on film, was seen within the courtyard of the headquarters building. The Wagner forces fortified their position by planting landmines and establishing security checkpoints in the city center of Rostov. Wagner members sported silver armbands to distinguish themselves.\n",
      "Prigozhin held a meeting with Deputy Defense Minister Yunus-bek Yevkurov and Deputy Chief of Staff Vladimir Alekseyev at the headquarters, during which Yevkurov unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Prigozhin to withdraw his troops. Prigozhin then hunkered down in a bunker in the city and took up command as a detachment of some thousands of Wagner forces advanced on Moscow. Shooting and explosions were later heard. The Rostelecom building was fired at for unclear reasons. Unconfirmed videos hinted at confrontations between Wagner forces and the military within the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of Rostov's businesses and facilities remained closed. The municipal administration advised residents to stay at home (seemingly to little effect), but did not declare a counter-terrorism operations regime. Local shops reduced their operating hours, and long queues formed at gas stations. Some residents tried to stock up on essentials, while others sought to leave the city, resulting in traffic congestion and lengthy lines at the train station. However, there was no widespread panic among the populace. Certain residents congregated in the city center to meet Wagner fighters; the majority was supportive, although a few engaged in arguments with them. The Wagner mercenaries were pointedly amicable with the residents. Wagner forces subsequently urged civilians to stay off the streets for their own safety after which shooting and explosions broke out.\n",
      "Eyewitness footage depicted a long convoy of military and civilian vehicles heading towards the city, purportedly comprising Chechen paramilitaries (Kadyrovites) with the objective of engaging the Wagner forces. According to Chechen state media and various accounts, they did not reach the city center and did not enter into any hostilities. A commander of the Chechen forces later said that some of their teams had been as close as \"500-700 meters from Wagner fighters\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Advance towards Moscow ===\n",
      "\n",
      "A convoy of Wagner forces headed to Moscow while Prigozhin commanded the rebellion from Rostov-on-Don. The armored columns, consisting of a few thousand men with tanks, armored vehicles, anti-aircraft weaponry, and civilian trucks, began to advance rapidly towards Moscow in the early hours of 24 June. While one column reportedly came from Rostov-on-Don, another crossed over from the occupied territory of Ukraine. The vehicles advanced across Voronezh Oblast where they encountered little resistance. According to a source close to the leadership of the Donetsk People's Republic, the convoy bound for Moscow comprised approximately 5,000 combatants, reportedly under the leadership of the senior Wagner commander Dmitry Utkin. Russian military bloggers claimed that the number of Moscow-bound troops stood at 4,000. British intelligence reportedly estimated that some 8,000 Wagner mercenaries  participated in the rebellion (including troops which did not move towards Moscow), while Prigozhin claimed that the rebels were 25,000-strong. The column did not attempt to occupy any cities it passed through, although it might have taken control of several air bases.\n",
      "Outside the regional capital of Voronezh, halfway between Rostov-on-Don and Moscow, Wagner troops were attacked by a helicopter. The Russian Air Force suffered significant losses while confronting Wagner troops, with at least one helicopter and an Il-22M airborne command-center plane shot down. According to the British Ministry of Defence, the loss of the Il-22M was particularly significant, as it was one of only twelve aircraft of the type that had been key to the war effort against Ukraine, with Ukrainian forces unsuccessfully trying to shoot down such aircraft throughout the war. At least thirteen Russian military personnel were killed. Janes inferred the number to potentially be as high as 29, based on an estimation of the number of personnel needed to operate all of the reportedly destroyed equipment.\n",
      "Wagner fighters drove past Voronezh and continued to push through Voronezh Oblast throughout the early afternoon without entering important cities. Social media posts also showed footage of fighting between Wagner troops and the military in Voronezh proper, with Reuters citing military reports. Two missiles—likely fired by Wagner's air defense systems—struck an oil depot and a courtyard of a housing complex in Voronezh. According to media reports, Wagner took control of all military facilities in the city.\n",
      "Wagner proceeded into Lipetsk Oblast, approximately 400 kilometres (250 mi) from Moscow. They passed through the town of Yelets, and continued north along the M4 highway. In Lipetsk Oblast, authorities deliberately demolished highways using excavators in an effort to impede the convoy's progress. Some roadways were blocked with trucks and school buses. The military set up defensive lines along the Oka river (which flows just south of Moscow) and barricaded bridge crossings. The governors of Lipetsk Oblast and Voronezh Oblast urged all civilians to stay indoors, following reports of military columns and clashes along the M4 highway.\n",
      "Prigozhin subsequently claimed that two Russian military defectors were killed while fighting alongside Wagner. The Dutch OSINT website Oryx recorded five destroyed vehicles on the rebels' side, and two captured vehicles on the side of the government forces.\n",
      "There are reports that the closest to Moscow that Wagner troops got was the town of Kashira in southern Moscow Oblast, 95 kilometres (59 mi) south of Moscow. Wagner presence is not visually confirmed any closer than Krasnoye in northern Lipetsk Oblast, 330 kilometres (210 mi) south of Moscow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Security measures ===\n",
      "Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, declared the implementation of the counter-terrorism operations regime in the capital. Armoured vehicles and an increased presence of security forces was observed throughout Moscow. Municipal authorities contemplated a curfew, and billboards advertising Wagner recruitment were seen being hastily dismantled. Der Spiegel reported a complete sell-out of all flights departing from Moscow as people sought to escape the impending situation. According to the airplane-tracking website Flightradar24, an aircraft used by Putin took off from Moscow and headed towards St. Petersburg. However, according to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, Putin was not on board, and he remained in the Kremlin. Authorities also announced travel restrictions in Kaluga Oblast, which is adjacent to Moscow, with Governor Vladislav Shapsha telling residents to \"refrain from travelling by private vehicle on these roads unless absolutely necessary\".\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Federal Security Service (FSB) raided Wagner headquarters in Saint Petersburg. Unconfirmed reports in Russian media said cardboard boxes containing 4 billion rubles ($47 million) were discovered from vehicles near the office, and that cash in U.S. dollars, handguns, gold bars and packs of an unknown white powder were also seized. Prigozhin said that the money was intended for employee salaries, compensations to relatives of fallen Wagner mercenaries and other company expenses. He hinted at Wagner's covert global influence operations, including activities in Africa and the United States, which necessitated the use of cash. The offices of a key Prigozhin media holding were also raided, with investigators seizing computers and documents. Olga Romanova, a journalist and leader of the Russian civil rights organization Russia Behind Bars, accused the FSB of threatening relatives of convicts recruited by Wagner since the early hours of 24 June. According to The Daily Telegraphs anonymous sources, U.K. intelligence similarly found that Russian intelligence agencies threatened to harm families of Wagner leaders during its advance on Moscow.\n",
      "On 4 July 10 billion RUB in cash found in Wagner offices was officially returned to Prigozhin, but no information was released on the whereabouts of the seized gold and white powder.\n",
      "On 22 December, The Wall Street Journal, citing sources from Western and Russian intelligence agencies, alleged that Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council of Russia, had also requested military assistance from Kazakhstan in the event of the Russian military failing to put down the rebellion, but was refused by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Events in Syria ===\n",
      "In Syria, where Wagner forces were part of the Russian military presence in the country's civil war, sources told Reuters that local authorities and Russian military commanders launched a swift crackdown on the Wagner Group to prevent the spread of the rebellion there.\n",
      "In the first hours of the revolt, about a dozen Wagner officers deployed in Homs Governorate and other areas were summoned to the Russian military base at Hmeimim, in the west of the country, according to Syrian military sources. Syrian military intelligence then cut communications overnight on 23 June from areas where Wagner forces operated to prevent them from communicating among themselves and with contacts in Russia. Wagner fighters were then asked to sign contracts putting them under the control of the Russian Defence Ministry and agreeing to a pay cut, with those refusing being removed from Syria aboard Russian Ilyushin aircraft. Those who refused were said to be \"in the dozens\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Resolution ==\n",
      "Prigozhin allegedly made personal efforts to establish contact with the presidential administration on the afternoon of 24 June, including reaching out to Putin himself, who refused to speak with him. Final negotiations were reportedly conducted by Anton Vaino, the chief of staff, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of the Security Council, and Boris Gryzlov, the Russian ambassador to Belarus. Prigozhin strongly insisted that high-ranking officials participate in the negotiations, with Putin's refusal to engage paving the way for Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's intervention. Lukashenko reportedly spoke with Prigozhin upon Putin's request, acting as a mediator to broker a settlement. They reached an agreement, which entailed the Wagner fighters ceasing their advancement and returning to their base, in exchange for a guarantee of their safety. Lukashenko later recalled:\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, 'Zhenya [the diminutive for Yevgeniy], no one will give you either Shoigu or Gerasimov, especially in this situation, you know Putin as well as I do. Secondly, he will not only not meet with you. He will not talk to you on the phone due to this situation'. Prigozhin was silent at first, but then burst out: 'But we want justice! They want to strangle us! We'll go to Moscow!'. I said, 'Halfway there you'll just be crushed like a bug'.\n",
      "In an audio statement, Prigozhin stated that he had accepted the deal to prevent bloodshed, and re-explained his motivations for the rebellion, emphasizing that it was not a coup attempt:\n",
      "\n",
      "They wanted to disband the Wagner military company. We embarked on a march of justice on June 23. In 24 hours, we got to within 200 kilometers of Moscow. In this time, we did not spill a single drop of our fighters' blood. Now the moment has come when blood could be spilled. Understanding responsibility [for the chance] that Russian blood will be spilled on one side, we are turning our columns around and going back to field camps as planned.\n",
      "At around 11:00 p.m. (GMT+3) on 24 June, the Wagner Group commenced the withdrawal of their forces from Rostov-on-Don. Residents of Rostov-on-Don cheered Wagner troops as they left the city, and some approached Prigozhin's vehicle and shook Prigozhin's hand through the window. When asked to comment on the outcome of the revolt in the last known video of him during the rebellion, Prigozhin responded with levity: \"It's normal, we have cheered everyone up\". On 25 June, Wagner forces started to withdraw from Voronezh. Wagner forces reportedly returned to their positions in occupied regions of eastern Ukraine.\n",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced that the charges against Prigozhin would be dropped and that Prigozhin would be sent to Belarus. According to Peskov, Wagner fighters would not face prosecution, and those who did not participate in the rebellion would have the option to sign contracts with the Ministry of Defence. Peskov further conveyed that the Wagner organization as a whole would return to its previous wartime deployment locations. Putin's office reportedly expressed gratitude to Lukashenko for his efforts in quelling the rebellion.\n",

      "\n",
      "Vladimir Putin addressed the nation on 24 June, denouncing Wagner's actions as \"treason\" and vowing to take \"harsh steps\" to suppress the rebellion. He stated the situation threatened the existence of Russia itself. Putin drew historical parallels to the Russian Revolution, which unfolded during the Russian Empire's engagement on the Eastern Front of World War I and resulted in territorial losses in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Furthermore, Putin made an appeal to the Wagner forces who \"by deceit or threats\" had been \"dragged\" into participating in the rebellion. After airing Putin's address, TV stations returned to their scheduled programming.\n",
      "In response, Prigozhin stated that his main goal was to remove Shoigu and Gerasimov from office and reiterated his accusations of corruption against the MoD.\n",

      "\n",
      "==== Other government-aligned figures ====\n",
      "Prominent Russian establishment politicians called on Prigozhin to stop his rebellion and expressed support for Putin. Dmitry Medvedev, the leader of United Russia, the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, and a former president of the country, stated that \"the world will be put on the brink of destruction\" if Wagner would be able to take control of the government and gain access to nuclear weapons.\n",
      "Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic, called the mutiny \"treason\" and said his troops were en route to \"zones of tension\" to \"preserve Russia's units and defend its statehood\". Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus', leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, called on Russians to pray for Putin. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian State Duma, expressed support for Vladimir Putin. The leaders of Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia since 2014 also expressed support for Putin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Anti-war opposition and anti-government armed groups ====\n",
      "Russian opposition groups responded in a variety of ways. Exiled former oil magnate and opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky urged Russians to support Prigozhin, saying that it was important to back \"even the devil\" if he decided to take on the Kremlin. However, he later urged Russians to arm themselves, while stating that \"Prigozhin is not our friend and not even our ally\". Jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny criticized the event and Putin's handling of it writing \"The fact that Putin's war could ruin and disintegrate Russia is no longer a dramatic exclamation.\" He also slammed how the government treated Prigozhin and Wagner in the aftermath in comparison to how himself and his Anti-Corruption Foundation were treated.\n",
      "The anarchist organizations Combat Organization of Anarcho-Communists (BOAK) and Autonomous Action both expressed in separate statements that Prigozhin and Putin were equally despicable, and that anarchists had no \"side\" to take in the conflict. The BOAK urged fellow anarchists to \"stay away\", and let the warring factions \"bleed each other as much as possible. That way, they won't be able to disturb people in the future.\" They also urged to \"spend this time preparing for an armed conflict\". Russian Volunteer Corps leader Denis Kapustin praised Prigozhin, stating that despite their stark ideological differences, he considered Prigozhin \"a patriot of Russia.\" He later called for joining the rebellion. The Freedom of Russia Legion compared the events to those during the Russian Revolution but advised readers to remember Wagner's numerous war crimes. They urged people not to \"attribute military honor and valor to [Prigozhin] which does not exist.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Ultranationalists and milbloggers ====\n",
      "According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russian pro-war ultranationalists were divided between those who wanted to move past the rebellion and others who demanded solutions to the flaws in Russia's security exposed by the rebellion. Igor \"Strelkov\" Girkin called for the execution of Prigozhin for the rebellion and his \"murder\" of Russian officers, demanding it as \"necessary for the preservation of Russia as a state.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Wider public ====\n",
      "\n",
      "There were no sizeable spontaneous displays of public support for the Putin government during the rebellion. The Russian population displayed a predominantly \"silent\" and apathetic reaction. Russia analyst Anna Matveeva contrasted the Russian public's response to that of the Turkish public during the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt, where numerous Turkish citizens actively participated in anti-coup demonstrations. In Rostov-on-Don, which was occupied by Wagner forces, videos emerged of residents welcoming the rebels, bringing them amenities and cheering.\n",
      "A survey by Russian Field, a Moscow-based opinion poll company, released on 3 July, found that public support for Prigozhin fell by 26 percentage points in the days after his unsuccessful rebellion, but that 29% of survey respondents continued to view Prigozhin positively. It is difficult to accurately capture public opinion in Russia; at least 70% of people whom Russian Fields contacted by telephone refused to respond to the poll. The pollster's findings of a sharp drop in support for Prigozhin was consistent with the findings of a separate sentiment analysis study of Russian social media and internet comments.\n",
      "After explosions near Voronezh caused by Russian artillery fire, the previously existing Internet meme \"to bomb Voronezh\", which referred to self-destructive blunders by the Russian government, resurfaced on Russian social media.\n",

      "=== International ===\n",
      "Western leaders mostly refrained from directly commenting on the rebellion as it unfolded and immediately after, primarily due to concerns that Putin would exploit such comments to claim that it was a foreign conspiracy. Additionally, concerns were raised over control of the Russian nuclear arsenal. U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the situation with French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Following the rebellion's conclusion, Biden said that Putin had \"absolutely\" been weakened by the mutiny.\n",
      "In a phone conversation with Putin on 24 June, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that Turkey was ready to assist in finding a \"peaceful resolution\" and urged Putin to act sensibly.\n",

      "Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, stated that \"Russia's weakness is obvious\" and that the insurrection was evidence of Russia's political instability, including infighting among elites. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the rebellion an opportunity for the international community to \"abandon false neutrality\" on Russia and to provide the Ukrainian government with all the weapons it needs to push Russian forces out of Ukraine.\n",
      "Moldovan foreign minister Nicu Popescu said that the events in Russia were proof that Moldova should continue on its trajectory of distancing itself from the \"Eurasian space of destruction and war\" and towards the European Union to ensure peace, stability and democracy in the country.\n",
      "Commenting on the negotiations, Belarusian President Lukashenko claimed to have convinced Putin to engage in dialogue with Prigozhin rather than assassinating him \"because afterwards there will be no negotiations and these guys will be ready to do anything\". Lukashenko also claimed that Belarus' national defense will benefit from Wagner's expertise. Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated on Twitter that the rebellion exposed the \"weakness\" of Putin and other dictatorial regimes, and stated that \"We must seize this moment now.\" Kastuś Kalinoŭski Regiment commander Dzianis Prokharaŭ expressed a similar sentiment in a video address on social media, calling on Belarusian military personnel not to interfere in the events. Valery Sakhashchyk, the Representative for Defense and National Security in the Belarusian United Transitional Cabinet in exile, called for a quick decision to either \"use [the] historical chance and become a prosperous European country\" or \"lose everything\". He called for the Belarusian military to assert the Nation's independence from Russia, to \"unite the nation\", and to \"tune in to our wave and stay in touch\".\n",

The \"counter-terrorism operations regime\" was lifted in Moscow on 26 June. Following the uprising, the value of the Russian ruble sharply declined, reaching its lowest exchange rate since March 2022. On 26 June, the MoD made an official announcement stating that Shoigu had paid a visit to the troops stationed in Ukraine. Shoigu was prominently featured in state media coverage, often appearing alongside Putin, in the following days, in an apparent show of confidence. Moreover, Putin undertook a series of public meet-and-greets, a departure from his typically secretive nature, seemingly aiming to showcase public backing. On 10 July, the Defence Ministry released video footage purportedly showing Gerasimov listening to a report about Ukrainian missile attacks, his first public appearance since the revolt.\n",

      "=== Subsequent statements ===\n",
      "On 26 June, Prigozhin released a recorded statement in which he defended the insurrection. He claimed that the objective was to save the Wagner Group and hold accountable inept government officials. Prigozhin emphasized that the uprising aimed not to overthrow the government and reiterated his accusation that the shelling of Wagner troops by the regular military sparked the rebellion.  Prigozhin also favorably compared Wagner's ability to credibly threaten to capture Moscow with the military's failed attempt to capture Kyiv.\n",
      "Hours after Prigozhin's audio message, Putin addressed the nation once again. He rebuked the unnamed individuals who led the rebellion and reiterated his belief that it constituted an act of betrayal. However, Putin characterized Wagner commanders and fighters as predominantly patriots who were \"covertly used against their comrades-in-arms.\" He confirmed that Russian servicemen were killed by Wagner, referring to them as heroes. Putin also stated that members of the group who do not wish to become regular contractors were allowed to transfer to Belarus.\n",

      "On 27 June, Russian authorities said they had closed the criminal investigation and dropped the charges against Prigozhin or any other participants in the rebellion, and that Wagner's heavy military equipment was to be transferred to the Russian armed forces. The authorities stated that rebels had \"stopped the actions directly aimed at committing a crime\". In Belarus, construction of camps for the Wagner Group was reported to have begun in Mogilev Region. On the same day, Lukashenko confirmed the arrival of Prigozhin in Belarus, saying that he was welcome to stay \"for some time\".\n",
      "Also on 27 June, Putin said that the Wagner Group was \"fully financed\" by the Russian government. This was the first admission by Putin of a link between Wagner and the Russian government, reversing years of Kremlin's denials of any connection. Putin said that the Russian government paid more than 86 billion RUB (940 million USD) to Wagner from May 2022 to May 2023. Although Putin claimed that Wagner was \"fully\" funded by the state, the group also obtains revenue from other sources, including Prigozhin's business dealings and payments from governments who hired Wagner (such as the Malian government, which reportedly had paid Wagner more than $10 million each month). Putin's admission that Wagner was state-funded carries implications on the question of whether Russia is responsible, under the law of armed conflict, for atrocities committed by Wagner personnel in Central African Republic and elsewhere around the world.\n",
      "On 29 June, the BBC rang over a dozen recruitment centers using Russian phone numbers including in Volgograd, Krasnodar, Murmansk and Kaliningrad. The BBC was told that they were still signing contracts with the Wagner group and not the Russian MoD. A man in Volgograd said to the BBC: \"It's absolutely nothing to do with the defence ministry... Nothing has stopped, we're still recruiting.\"\n",

      "==== Crackdown on Wagner, alleged purges and related arrests ====\n",
      "In the week following the rebellion, Putin moved to take control of the network of business enterprises previously controlled by Prigozhin and Wagner, including hundreds of businesses in Russia and abroad. Prigozhin's media empire was dismantled, and his propaganda operation was taken over by the government, with internet polemicists that had previously backed Prigozhin and attacked his enemies beginning to attack Prigozhin instead. Prigozhin's catering businesses began losing government contracts. On 29 June, the milblogger Rybar, a former press officer for the MoD claimed that a purge was underway, targeting generals who demonstrated \"a lack of decisiveness\" when dealing with Wagner.\n",
      "Multiple publications reported that General Sergey Surovikin had been arrested by authorities after the rebellion. However, on 12 July, the head of the defence committee of the State Duma, Andrey Kartapolov, said that he was \"resting.\" On 22 August, Surovikin was reportedly removed as commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces. On 29 June, Surovikin's deputy, Colonel-General Andrei Yudin, was fired from the army. On 5 July, General Yunus-bek Yevkurov was noted to have been absent from a military meeting.\n",
      "On 5 July, Sergei Mikhailov, the general director of the state news agency TASS, was replaced by Andrey Kondrashov, who was the press secretary for Putin's reelection campaign in 2018. The Institute for the Study of War said it was a possible indication of the Kremlin's unhappiness with media coverage of the rebellion.\n",
      "On 21 July, Igor Girkin, who commanded separatist fighters during the War in Donbas and was convicted in absentia by a Dutch court for the MH-17 shootdown in 2015, was detained by the FSB according to his wife Miroslava, on charges of extremism. He had been an open critic of Putin and his generals' handling of the war in Ukraine and called for his overthrow earlier in the week. The RBC newspaper reported that his arrest was possibly related to a petition from a member of the Wagner Group.\n",
      "On 5 July, the state television channel Russia-1 broadcast a program on Prigozhin and the Wagner Group, calling Prigozhin a traitor and adding that criminal cases against him over his rebellion were still ongoing. It published footage of what was supposedly Prigozhin's opulent residence. Images purportedly showing of Prigozhin wearing wigs and various disguises also surfaced on the internet.\n",
      "According to a Guardian report published on 6 July based on sources with knowledge of Wagner's African operations, there had been no abnormal movements of Wagner personnel in Africa since the abortive rebellion. However, on the same day as the Guardian report, the newspaper Jeune Afrique reported the departure of Wagner personnel in the Central African Republic, with more than 600 employees departing from Bangui M'Poko International Airport, citing NGOs and analysts. Video also emerged showing uniformed Wagner operatives reports gathering from a helipad. The movements were later claimed by the office of President Faustin-Archange Touadéra on 8 July as a regular rotation.\n",
      "On 12 July, the Russian Ministry of Defence said that the Wagner Group had turned over more than 2,000 pieces of military hardware, which included tanks, mobile rocket launchers and anti-aircraft systems. The Ministry also said it received \"more than 2,500 tons of various types of ammunition and about 20,000 small arms.\"\n",
      "On 13 July, the US Department of Defense assessed that the Wagner Group was no longer participating significantly in military operations in Ukraine.\n",
      "On 14 July, the Belarusian Defence Ministry said that the Wagner Group had begun training soldiers in the country and released a video showing Wagner fighters instructing Belarusian soldiers at a military range near Osipovichi, about 90 kilometers (56 miles) southeast of the capital Minsk.\n",
      "On 15 July, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine confirmed the arrival of the Wagner Group in Belarus, with an unconfirmed report saying that a convoy of some 60 Wagner vehicles had entered the country. It estimated that they had been deployed at least 100 kilometers from the Ukrainian border and put the number of mercenaries in the hundreds. Its spokesman said that they did not believe the deployment posed a serious threat to Ukraine but warned that Wagner could be used to destabilize the situation along the border.\n",

      "==== Prigozhin's return to Russia ====\n",
      "On 27 June, Lukashenko confirmed the arrival of Prigozhin in Belarus saying that he was welcome to stay \"for some time\". But on 6 July, Lukashenko said Prigozhin had returned to Russia and was in Saint Petersburg.\n",
      "The French newspaper Libération, citing Western intelligence sources, reported that Prigozhin had been back in Moscow since at least 1 July to negotiate the Wagner Group's fate with Putin, and that he met with Russian National Guard commander Viktor Zolotov and SVR head Sergey Naryshkin. On 10 July, the Kremlin said that Putin met with Prigozhin and 35 other commanders of the Wagner Group on 29 June to discuss developments in Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that the president \"gave an assessment of the company's actions on the front,\" as well as on the rebellion, while listening to the commanders' explanations and suggesting \"variants of their future employment\" and combat roles. Peskov also said that Prigozhin expressed Wagner's unconditional support for Putin. In an interview published on 13 July by the newspaper Kommersant, Putin said he offered to retain Wagner as its own unit in the Russian military led by their current commander, who the newspaper identified only by his call sign of \"Grey Hair\", only for Prigozhin to reject the proposal. Putin also insisted that the Wagner Group could not exist in its current form, citing the law against private military organizations.\n",
      "On 19 July, Prigozhin made his first public appearance since the end of the rebellion. In a phone video showing him addressing his men, he said his forces would no longer fight in Ukraine and focus on training soldiers in Belarus and maintaining its activities in Africa instead. Following that, in late July, he was present on the sidelines of the 2023 Russia–Africa Summit in Saint Petersburg.\n",

      "On 23 August, Prigozhin and nine others including Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin were killed in a plane crash as his private jet traveled from Moscow to Saint Petersburg. Russian state-owned media agency TASS reported that Prigozhin had been on the passenger list of the flight. A Wagner-associated Telegram channel claimed the jet was shot down by Russian air defenses over Tver Oblast. The passengers' deaths were officially confirmed on 27 August, following genetic analysis conducted on the remains recovered from the wreckage.\n",

      "In response to events, Estonia strengthened its border security, while Latvia closed its border with Russia and suspended the entry of Russian citizens. Concerned about the potential concentration of Wagner forces in neighboring Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania made a joint request to NATO for additional troops to be deployed to their countries, specifically along the eastern border of the alliance. Responding to earlier tentative plans to reinforce Lithuania, German Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius announced on 26 June that Germany, as the leading nation of the existing NATO battle group stationed in Lithuania, would dispatch a complete brigade consisting of 4,000 troops. This deployment aims to establish the necessary infrastructure for permanent stationing by 2026. On 2 July, Poland announced it was sending 500 police and counterterrorist forces to reinforce its border with Belarus following the Wagner Group's redeployment there. It later sent an additional 1,000 soldiers and equipment to the border.\n",

      "=== Political ===\n",
      "The rebellion, the first of its kind in Russia since the constitutional crisis of 1993, was widely regarded in the following days as the most significant challenge to Putin's 23-year-long reign. Multiple publications have noted that the rebellion has weakened Putin's public image. Andrey Kolesnikov expressed a view that although the rebellion eroded Putin's image, the Russian population did not view Prigozhin's challenge to the establishment as a credible alternative. Therefore, they are assessed likely to continue providing support, whether genuine or feigned, to Putin's administration. According to some analysts, the rebellion laid bare an inherent weakness of Putin's system of power built upon a ruling coalition of competing power centers and a structure of subordinate \"nominal\" institutions that was strained by the descent into a militarised state and society. According to a New York Times analysis, the rebellion undermined Putin's legitimacy which relies on being viewed as a guarantor of stability and security, which may cause a lasting erosion of support among the Russian power elite. According to Meduza, the rebellion did not last long enough to show whether Prigozhin's radical populist rhetoric enjoyed a genuine base of support among Russia's security services.\n",
      "Prigozhin's failed rebellion has been described as a desperate last-ditch effort in a losing power struggle against factions within the Russian establishment that he despised. According to some commentators, the rebellion ended with relatively few immediate repercussions for the perpetrators that had been labelled as traitors by Putin, suggesting that Putin's rule was weak enough to challenge.\n",
      "The head of the Russian National Guard, Viktor Zolotov, was described as emerging victorious from the rebellion. Zolotov claimed credit and was praised by Putin for defending the capital Moscow against the Wagner Group. On 27 June, Putin declared that the Russian National Guard would be equipped with heavy weapons, including tanks, in order to suppress any potential future uprisings and assume a more prominent position in the Russo-Ukraine conflict. According to Time magazine, Zolotov's increased authority may signify the initiation of a purge of Putin's opponents.\n",
      "The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said that Lukashenko was using his role in resolving the rebellion to gain influence and leverage in his relation with Russia, and that he may use the presence of Wagner to reduce the Belarusian military's dependence on Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Military ===\n",
      "Western officials believed that Prigozhin would have faced a decisive defeat had he tried to capture Moscow and that this was likely the reason why Prigozhin ultimately agreed to a negotiated resolution. According to Western intelligence analysis, had a negotiated solution not been reached, the rebellion would have likely culminated in a violent showdown in Moscow, resulting in the deaths of thousands. Meanwhile, according to a Guardian analysis, \"The emerging consensus – from experts and in western capitals – is [that the rebellion] was far less than an attempted coup, and more an impulsive demonstration that quickly got out of hand.\" According to The Guardian, air strikes on the column were conducted because no ground defense force was available to counter the convoy and with Moscow's defenses deficient, it was conceivable that the Wagner convoy would have penetrated the hastily erected defensive lines on the Oka River and reached the roadway circle surrounding Moscow and possibly have captured the capital, however, this may have been a futile act as it was becoming increasingly clear that he failed to rally outside support which was essential for his rebellion to succeed. The ISW assessed that Wagner staked its chances on quickly rallying sufficient support from parts of the regular military to make an armed conflict with forces loyal to the MoD feasible.\n",
      "According to a senior U.S. Department of Defense official, U.S. intelligence agencies monitored the defection of large numbers of Russian soldiers from their military commanders, who then joined the Wagner movement. The official further stated that the operations carried out by Wagner were widely supported by soldiers and officers deployed inside Ukraine as well as in Russian territory and bases near the Ukrainian border. U.S. and allied officials and independent experts consulted by The New York Times said that Prigozhin appeared to believe that a significant part of the Russian military would take his side during the rebellion.\n",
      "The ISW commented that \"the rebellion exposed the weakness of the Russian security forces and demonstrated Putin's inability to use his forces in a timely manner to repel an internal threat and further eroded his monopoly on force\"; and that the Russian military's combat capabilities did not seem to be \"substantially impacted\" by the rebellion. According to CNN, allies cautioned Ukraine to avoid taking advantage of the rebellion to conduct strikes inside Russian territory. According to analysts consulted by The New York Times, the enduring systemic problems within the Russian military, which were strongly criticized by Prigozhin and widely condemned by the soldiers, were likely to persist following the rebellion. This, in turn, would exacerbate the decline in morale.\n",

      "2022 Sheffield gas supply outage\n",
      "\n",
      "The city of Sheffield, England was impacted by a major failure of the local natural gas supply network in December 2022, resulting in a loss of central heating and gas stove availability to more than 3,000 properties in the northwestern suburbs of the city. The outage, which has predominantly affected the Hillsborough, Malin Bridge and Stannington districts, was declared a major incident by Sheffield City Council; some properties were without a gas supply for almost two weeks.\n",
      "The gas supply outage affected the Cadent Gas network, and was caused by a burst water main on the Yorkshire Water network which resulted in more than 2 million litres of water flooding into the gas supply network. Yorkshire Water confirmed that the breach to the water main had been resolved by 6 December. In addition to the widespread gas supply outage, numerous properties in the affected areas have also suffered from outages to their water and electricity supplies as knock-on effects.\n",
      "Heavy rainfall initially hampered recovery work, followed by cold temperatures and snowfall. In response to the widespread lack of heating availability and increasingly cold temperatures, dropping as low as −3 °C (27 °F) on 9 December, a major incident was declared by local authorities. The Red Cross distributed aid, including food, drinks and blankets, to residents in the affected area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Timeline ==\n",
      "During the evening of 2 December, a water main on Bankfield Lane at the western end of Stannington burst, resulting in flooding in the local area. The affected water main was an asbestos-cement mainline pipe installed in 1970. More than 2 million litres of water, roughly equivalent to three Olympic-sized swimming pools, entered the gas mains in this area and subsequently flowed through pipes down hillsides throughout the Stannington and Hillsborough areas.\n",
      "Property damage was reported in dozens of homes across the affected area, including on High Matlock Road, as water overflowed out of gas meters and gas stoves inside homes; water also overflowed out of manhole covers and the bases of street lights in outdoor areas. Emergency services attended the incident from around midnight, going from door to door to wake residents. Cadent Gas, who operate the natural gas network in the area, described the incident as \"unpredecented\" and something which they had never had to deal with before.\n",
      "By 3 December more than 1,000 properties were without a gas supply; in addition, many properties in the immediate area of the burst water main also suffered from reduced water supplies, or no water at all, for several days. Engineers from Cadent Gas initially had to go from door to door and turn off the gas supply at each individual affected property, before engineers could commence work to drain and repair the gas network; more than 100 engineers were drafted in to work 24 hours a day to resolve the outage, later rising to more than 200 as the incident progressed.\n",
      "The number of properties affected by the gas supply outage rose to more than 2,000 by 6 December, increasingly affecting homes lower down the hillside in the Hillsborough area of Sheffield. Local electricity network operator Northern Powergrid warned local residents to only use portable electric heaters in occupied rooms and only while residents were at home, in order to reduce strain on the local power supply caused by increased usage of electric heating. Despite this however, residents on some streets in Stannington began to report intermittent power outages throughout the day. Electric car owners were advised to use public charging points rather than those at their own homes.\n",
      "The local authority, Sheffield City Council, officially declared a major incident on 7 December, with thousands of properties still without a gas supply and temperatures forecast to drop below freezing for prolonged periods in the coming days. Only around a quarter of affected properties had had their gas supplies reconnected at the time that the major incident was declared, according to Cadent Gas, as their engineers were struggling to pump the large quantities of water out of the complex local gas network; engineers and equipment were shipped in from across the country to assist in draining the network.\n",
      "According to Cadent Gas, around three-quarters of affected properties had been reconnected to the gas network by 10 December. Considerable difficulties remained in draining water from the gas network in the Hillsborough and Malin Bridge areas, where hundreds of homes still remained without gas.\n",
      "\n",

      "== Response ==\n",
      "Refuge spaces were opened officially by the local authorities and unofficially by local businesses, providing warm spaces, hot food and drinks to affected residents. The primary official refuge was opened at Lomas Hall, a church hall on Church Street in Stannington, where residents were issued with portable electric heaters and electric hotplates for cooking. The Peacock Inn pub on Stannington Road opened to provide residents with food and hot drinks, while the nearby Crown & Glove pub on Uppergate Road opened to provide showering facilities.\n",
      "Schools in the affected areas remained open, despite the interruption to their gas supplies; individual classrooms were heated using portable electric heaters, and Nook Lane Junior School advised parents to send children to school wearing additional warm clothing and with a packed lunch due to the unavailability of their kitchen facilities.\n",
      "The Liberal Democrat councillor for the Stannington ward, Penny Baker, praised local residents for showing resilience and \"community spirit\" by coming together in the face of the crisis. Terry Fox, the leader of Sheffield City Council, declared a major incident on 7 December, stating that it would allow the local authorities to \"better co-ordinate the overall response\" to the crisis.\n",
      "Olivia Blake, the Labour Member of Parliament for the Sheffield Hallam constituency in which Stannington is located, raised the gas supply outage during a debate in the House of Commons on 7 December, asking for direct government assistance and emergency funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Aftermath ==\n",
      "Yorkshire Water issued an apology to affected customers on 6 December, stating that they \"understood how difficult it was\" for affected residents. The water company was criticised for their part in causing the crisis, although a spokesperson maintained that the affected water main had previously been in a good condition and had not suffered any problems in more than a decade. Cadent Gas initially announced that residents would be compensated for any extra electricity usage caused by increased usage of portable electric heaters and other devices, before confirming that affected residents would receive double the usual rate of compensation for a gas outage, totalling £910 for a seven-day outage (or £1,470 for a commercial property).\n",
      "Angry local residents interrupted a news conference being held by Yorkshire Water director Neil Dewis in Stannington on 9 December, heckling him and accusing the company of not taking the situation seriously. Residents claimed that there had been up to ten recent burst water mains in the Stannington area prior to the major incident, accusing Yorkshire Water of providing inadequate maintenance. In contrast, efforts by Cadent Gas and Northern Powergrid to deal with the crisis were praised by local residents.\n",
      "Cadent appointed Aspect Maintenance from London as major contractor to replace hundreds of damaged gas appliances by 45 Engineers working 12 hours each day 7 days a week for 4 months.\n",

      "Mahsa Amini protests\n",
      "\n",
      "Civil unrest and protests against the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran associated with the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini (Persian: مهسا امینی) began on 16 September 2022 and carried on into 2023, but were said to have \"dwindled\" or \"died down\" by spring of 2023.  As of September 2023, the \"ruling elite\" of Iran was said to remain \"deeply entrenched\" in power. The protests were described as \"unlike any the country had seen before\", the \"biggest challenge\" to the government, and \"most widespread revolt\", since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n",
      "Mahsa Amini was arrested by the Guidance Patrol on 13 September 2022 for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory hijab law by wearing her hijab \"improperly\" while visiting Tehran from Saqqez. According to eyewitnesses, she was severely beaten by Guidance Patrol officers (this was denied by Iranian authorities). She subsequently collapsed, was hospitalized and died three days later. As the protests spread from Amini's hometown of Saqqez to other cities in the Iranian Kurdistan and throughout Iran, the government responded with widespread Internet blackouts, nationwide restrictions on social media usage, tear gas and gunfire.\n",
      "Although the protests have not been as deadly as those in 2019 (when more than 1,500 were killed), they have been \"nationwide, spread across social classes, universities, the streets [and] schools\". At least 551 people, including 68 minors, had been killed as a result of the government's intervention in the protests, as of 15 September 2023. Before February 2023 when most were pardoned, an estimated 19,262 were arrested across at least 134 cities and towns and 132 universities.\n",
      "Female protesters, including schoolchildren, have played a key role in the demonstrations. In addition to demands for increased rights for women, the protests have demanded the overthrow of the Islamic Republic, setting them apart from previous major protest movements in Iran, which have focused on election results or economic woes. \n",
      "The government's response to the protests and its \"brutal and disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters and children\" was widely condemned, but Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the unrest as \"riots\" and part of a \"hybrid war\" against Iran created by foreign enemy states and dissidents abroad.\n",
      "On March 6, 2024, the UN accused Iran of coordinating crimes against humanity, which the government rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Condition of women and the Islamic Republic ===\n",
      "Among the primary tenets of the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution was the need to overthrow the (allegedly) anti-Islamic, oppressive and foreign power-controlled   monarchy  of Iran. The secular, modernizing Pahlavi dynasty, founded by Reza Shah in the early twentieth century (1925), had placed the improved treatment of women at the center of its project to modernize Iran. Reza Shah banned the wearing of hijab in public and admitted women to universities. During the reign of his successor and son Mohammad Reza Shah, restrictions on the wearing of hijab were lifted but women were granted suffrage, allowed to enter parliament, and \"gained dramatically more rights in marriage\".\n",
      "The Revolution rescinded the legal rights the Pahlavi Shahs granted women, removed restrictions on men's rights to polygamy and child marriage, and reversed Reza Shah's ban on hijab to make the complete covering of women's hair in public compulsory. Enforcement of the unpopular law was eased during the 2013–2021 tenure of moderate President Rouhani, but intensified under Rouhani's successor, the hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi.\n",
      "At the same time as rights were taken away, some aspects of the lives of women and girls improved. Traditional pious Iranians—who had kept their daughters out of school during the Shah's era—now felt comfortable allowing their daughters to be schooled in an Islamic educational system. Enrollment of women in universities jumped from 3% in 1977 to 67% in 2015, according to the World Bank statistics. But many of the women who left home to study and developed new values and world views, struggled to secure jobs that matched their new competencies, and became less content with the Islamic Republic than their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Protest movements under the Islamic Republic ===\n",
      "The Mahsa Amini protests were preceded by several other political/social/economic protest movements in Iran, in 1999, 2009, 2011–2012, 2019–2020, and protests against compulsory hijab in 2017–18. \n",
      "Most recently were a series of protests in 2019, \"Bloody Aban\" (Persian: آبان خونین, a month near November in the Iranian calendar), sparked by a 50–200% increase in fuel prices. Like the Mahsa Amini protests, these protests eventually called for the overthrow of the government of the Islamic Republic and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Mahsa Amini's arrest and death in custody ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Mahsa Amini, also Jina Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, was arrested by the Guidance Patrol on 14 September 2022 because of an \"improper hijab.\" The police were accused of beating her and inflicting a fatal head injury, after a CT scan confirmed that Amini had sustained head injuries, a claim denied by Tehran police. She was pronounced dead on 16 September.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Protests ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Protests started at Mahsa Amini's funeral in Sanandaj, Kurdistan province, where hundreds of people reportedly gathered in defiance of official warnings and were fired upon when they shouted anti-regime slogans. Protests spread to the provincial capital. Internet service and mobile phone service were shut down, and the head of the Guidance Patrol was allegedly suspended. By 20 September there were unconfirmed social media videos showed anti-government protests in at least 16 of Iran's 31 provinces, and state media reported that three people had been killed in Kurdistan protests.\n",
      "Two weeks after the funeral, forty civilian were killed and many wounded in Zahedan in Sistan and Baluchestan province following Friday prayers, after protests sparked by reports of a police chief who had raped a 15-year-old girl in Chahbahar. A Mahsa Amini hashtag  gained 52 million tweets.\n",
      "By early December 2022, a \"vague\" statement made by the attorney general was interpreted by some in the Western press to mean that the hijab law was under review and that the Guidance Patrol might be disbanded. The report was later attacked as a \"diversion tactic\" by the regime.\n",
      "The protests became more widespread than those of 2009, 2017, and 2019, encompassing even Islamic Republic power bases such as the holy cities of Mashhad and Qom, involving both urban middle classes and rural working areas. In addition, schoolgirls demonstrated in numbers for the first time.\n",
      "By February 2023, the regime stated it had arrested tens of thousands of protesters.\n",
      "According to France 24, by mid-March 2023 protests \"had dwindled\" across most of the country. On March 13, the government claimed it had pardoned 22,000 citizens arrested for protesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Slogans and greviances ===\n",
      "The signature slogan of the protests has been \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" (Persian: زن، زندگی، آزادی, romanized: Zan, Zendegī, Āzādī, Kurdish: ژن، ژیان، ئازادی, romanized: Jin, Jiyan, Azadî), which reflects the idea that \"the rights of women are at the centre of life and liberty\". \n",
      "The slogan was popularized during women's marches in Turkey in 2006 in the Kurdish Freedom Movement, and reflects the idea of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, that \"a country can't be free unless the women are free.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kurds emphasize the Kurdish origin of the slogan, and its connection to Mahsa Amini's Kurdish first name—Jina. Kurdish and minority rights are subjects of the protest—Kurds make up approximately 15% of Iran's population, are predominately Sunni Muslims (also a minority), the regions they live are among the most impoverished in the country, the use of their languages is restricted, they account for nearly half of all political prisoners in Iran, and have felt much of the brunt of anti-protest attacks by the government (which attacked predominantly Kurdish cities, like Sanandaj and Oshnavieh) who according to news reports, blamed the Kurds for the protest movement.\n",
      "Other slogans collected by Iranwire early in the protests include comments against the Supreme Leader (“Death to the Dictator”, ”Khamenei is a Murderer, an Illegitimate Ruler”, “Death to Khamenei”), the Basij (“Undignified Basiji, You are Our ISIS”), the Islamic Republic (“We Don’t Want the Islamic Republic”); praise for Mahsa, and for the 20th century modernist monarch Reza Shah; and comments of defiance (“Iranians Die but Will Not Be Suppressed”).\n",
      "As demonstrated by the slogans and banners of the demonstrators, protesters appear to be demanding a wholesale change in government rather than just incremental reforms. Grievances expressed in the protest go beyond those of many previous Iranian protests, and beyond protesting Amini's death, demanding an end to the mandatory hijab, an end to the morality police, the Supreme Leader, the theocratic regime,\n",
      "and to human rights violations perpetrated by Iran's Guidance Patrol.\n",

      "=== Iranian public opinion ===\n",
      "In a November 2022 poll by Group for Analyzing and Measuring Attitudes in Iran (GAMAAN), almost three-quarters of Iranians opposed mandatory hijab; of this population, 84% prefer a secular Iranian state to theocracy, which GAMAAN characterized as an endorsement of regime change. According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, economic hardship and poor living conditions contributed to the growth of the protests. The New York Times itemized Iranian grievances such as \"soaring prices, high unemployment, corruption, (and) political repression\", and identified the poor Iranian economy as a major driving force behind the protests. According to an Iranian report in August 2021, a third of Iranians live in poverty. Abdolreza Davari, a conservative analyst, quoted a statistic that 95 percent of Iranians are \"worried about their livelihoods today and for their and their children's future.\" Only 15% of Iranians in the job market are women. Iran ranked 143rd out of 146 countries in the 2022 WEF Gender Gap Report, due in part to prohibitions on female membership in powerful government organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Protest techniques ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Protesters often stage small and quick, but numerous, \"flash mob\"-style gatherings. Drivers have blocked streets with their cars to slow down security forces. Roads have also been blocked by dumpster bins or even overturned police cars. Security forces on motorbikes cut through traffic, while firing on protesters. In some cases, security forces used paintballs to mark demonstrators. Some demonstrators packed extra clothes to replace painted clothes, wore masks to avoid identification, and dismantled public security cameras. Some protesters chanted from windows or rooftops. Symbolic protests include dyeing fountains blood-red, and women discarding and burning their hijabs or cutting their hair in public. Since turbans are viewed as a symbol of the regime, some Iranians engaged in turban throwing (knocking the turbans off of \"privileged\" Iranian clerics on the street and running away). Reformers such as Ahmad Zaidabadi criticized the trend as being unfair to Islamic scholars not involved with the regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Civil boycotts ===\n",
      "Some university teachers and professors declared their support for the student movement by boycotting classes or resigning. They included Nasrollah Hekmat (Shahid Beheshti University), Ammar Ashoori (Islamic Azad University), Lili Galehdaran (Shiraz Art University), Gholamreza Shahbazi (Art and Soureh Universities), Alireza Bahraini, Shahram Khazaei, and Azin Movahed (Sharif University of Technology, Tehran).\n",
      "On December 5 to 7, 2022, a general strike took place to put pressure on the regime.\n",
      "Protesters called for boycotts against goods manufactured by businesses reportedly tied to the regime, two examples being a major manufacturer of groceries and home goods as well as \"Iran’s version of Amazon, Digikala\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Media Western coverage ===\n",
      "Coverage of the protest was constrained by Iranian restrictions on speech, including internet shutdowns and arrests of journalists, such that \"the vast majority\" of Western media outlets had no presence in Iran (with the exception of NBC News) and had to obtain information from networks of contacts, human rights groups, and social media content. According to BBC News Persian Service, Iranian government disinformation contaminated social media as an information source, which must therefore be used with care. The Iranian government \"have a cyber army and they massively produce social media videos, even fake interviews.\" When foreign media quote them, it would be charged by the Iranian government for \"reporting fake news\".\n",

      "=== Casualties ===\n",
      "At least 551 people have been killed as of 15 September 2023, according to Iran Human Rights, including women and at least 68 children.  Death certificates obtained by Human Rights Activists in Iran, HRANA, confirm that many died from live bullets. The Norway-based group, Iran Human Rights, stated that with the current Internet blackouts, it was difficult to get accurate and up-to-date figures.  In addition to Amini herself, the death of several women protesters, including Nika Shakarami, Hadis Najafi and Sarina Esmailzadeh, were widely reported by the media. According to the families of deceased protesters, Iranian authorities have covered up killings of protesters by pressuring the families of victims, and by fabricating reports of suicides or car accidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Government casualties ====\n",
      "The Islamic Republican government has emphasized the loss of life from the government security forces (such as the Basij paramilitary volunteers and Revolutionary Guards), reporting that by 6 January 2023, 68 security force members had been killed in the unrest.  However, according to BBC Persian service, these figures may not be reliable as some of those reported by state media to be loyalist Basij militiamen killed by the \"rioters\" were actually protesters killed by security forces. Security forces (using state media to put out this story) had pressured the families of the deceased to go along with the false reporting, allegedly threatening them with death if they failed to cooperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Arrests and death sentences ===\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRANA), 19,262 Iranians across at least 134 cities and towns and 132 universities, were arrested as of 6 January 2023. In February 2023, Iran state media reported that in honour of the anniversary of the 1979 Iranian Islamic revolution, \"tens of thousands\" of Iranians arrested in connection with the Mahsa Amini protests had been pardoned. This did not include all protesters and some journalists arrested. The pardon had been requested by the head of the judiciary, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, who asserted that, “during recent events, a number of people, especially young people, committed wrong actions and crimes as a result of the indoctrination and propaganda of the enemy. Since the foreign enemies and anti-revolutionary currents’ plans have been foiled, many of these youth now regret their actions.”\n",
      "Prior to the release, hundreds of women have been detained and abused by the authorities who used torture and ill-treatment to obtain false confessions from them and from men who had also been arrested.  Some of those arrested were subjected to  “sham trials designed to intimidate those participating in the popular uprising that has rocked Iran”, according to Amnesty International.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least forty journalists have been detained by mid-October 2022. Anonymous sources cited by CBS News have stated that many protesters decline to seek medical assistance due to a reasonable fear of imprisonment.\n",
      "It was reported on 1 November 2022 that Iran had charged about a thousand people in Tehran for their alleged involvement in the protests and was holding public trials against the accused. A contradictory report from the state aligned news agency ISNA claimed that only 315 people were indicted in Tehran with more than 700 others indicted in other provinces. An informal network of activists inside Iran, known as the Volunteer Committee for Monitoring the Situation of Detainees, has alleged that as of 30 October, intelligence agencies reported the arrest of 130 human rights defenders, 38 women's rights advocates, 36 political activists, 19 lawyers and 38 journalists along with citizen protesters. An additional count of 308 university students and 44 minors that had been arrested by Iranian forces was also released by the Volunteer Committee.\n",
      "On 23 November 2022, Farideh Moradkhani, niece of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was arrested in Tehran after calling on foreign governments to cut ties with Iran following the government's protest crackdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Executions ====\n",
      "As of Spring 2023, seven individuals have been executed in connection with the protests.\n",
      "In November 2022, a Revolutionary Court in Tehran issued its first death sentence for one of the protesters on the charges of moharebeh (\"enmity against God\"), \"corruption on Earth\" and \"setting fire to a government centre, disturbing public order and collusion for committing crimes against national security\".\n",
      "The first execution of the Mahsa Amini protests took place on 8 December 2022, when 23-year-old Mohsen Shekari was hanged on charges of moharebeh for allegedly blocking a road and using a machete to wound a police officer. Iran Human Rights director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam called Shekari's trial a \"show trial without any due process\". On 12 December 2022, Iran publicly hanged a second protester, Majidreza Rahnavard.\n",
      "Two additional individuals, Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, were hanged on 7 January 2023, in connection with the alleged killing of a Basij paramilitary member during the protests. On 19 May 2023, three others, namely, Majid Kazemi, Saleh Mirhashemi, and Saeed Yaqoubi, were executed in connection with the protests.\n",

      "==== University students ====\n",
      "More than 1,200 Iranian university students at six universities were reportedly poisoned, displaying symptoms of vomiting, hallucinations, and severe body aches before they were due to attend anti-regime protests across the country. Videos posted online showed students dumping their canteen food onto the streets in protest. The Iranian science ministry blamed the illnesses on food poisoning, but the student union claimed that past experiences at Isfahan university and the sudden lack of electrolytes at university clinics suggested that the occurrence was the deliberate work of the regime aimed at thwarting the protests. Iranians called for a three-day period of national strikes and protests to begin on 7 December 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Schoolgirls ====\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in November 2022 and over the course of months, thousands of schoolgirls were hospitalized, in circumstances suspected to arise from mass toxic gas poisoning attacks. Some eyewitnesses reported signs of toxic gas attack. There were allegations that the poisonings were acts of retaliations by pro-regime actors against young women for their role in the protests against the mandatory hijab. According to one secondary schoolgirl from Tehran quoted by The New Yorker magazine, “It’s revenge for the disturbances we made. Not a single person disagrees.” The Islamic Republic regime arrested more than 100 people who claimed responsibility for the alleged poisonings.\n",
      "According to Nature magazine, an independent investigation would be required, including access to hospital test results and interviews with patients, in order to draw any firm conclusions about whether some or all of the incidents were real poisonings, or whether the entire epidemic could instead be attributed to mass psychogenic illness. The Guardian and others criticized Iran for its slow, opaque, and contradictory responses to the epidemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Statements by officials ===\n",
      "On 3 October 2022, the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ali Khamenei, commented for the first time on Amini's death and said that \"[her] death deeply broke my heart\" and called it a \"bitter incident\", while giving his full support to security forces against protesters. Khamenei dismissed the widespread unrest as \"riots\" caused by foreign states and dissidents abroad.\n",
      "On 10 October, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani called on foreigners to \"respect our laws\" and noted that Iran had arrested nine citizens of the European Union for supporting the protests.\n",
      "On 2 November, Khamenei described the events of the past few weeks as \"an hybrid war\" and said that \"the young people who came to the streets are our own children\". In April 2023, he further said that \"rejecting hijab was religiously and politically forbidden\" and that women who do this open up to foreign intelligence.\n",
      "The IRI foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, tweeted that the “various security services, Israel and some Western politicians who have made plans for civil war, destruction and the disintegration of Iran, should know that Iran is not Libya or Sudan.”\n",
      "In the week before 15 November 2022, 227 of Iran's 290 parliamentarians signed a statement declaring that protesters “waging war against God” should be dealt with in a way that would “teach an example.” Because \"waging war on God\" (engaging in moharebeh) is punishable by death in Iran, this statement led to widespread erroneous reporting that 15,000 protesters (the approximate number of those arrested) had been sentenced to death.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Government strategy and tactics ===\n",
      "The Islamic Republican government has worked to prevent the protesters from coordinating and from coming together under a unified leadership. To enforce domestic order against protesters, the IRI prefers to rely on its paramilitary militia, the Basij as in the past, revolts have turned into revolutions when professional militaries disobeyed orders to attack their own people (for example, during the 1991 Soviet coup attempt and the Iranian Revolution itself).\n",
      "During unrest, the IRI has maintained the capability to shut down Internet and cellphone services \n",
      "(with technological support from China and Russia), \n",
      "ensuring news of protest and communication between protesters is unavailable. If protesters bring phones and neglect to disable tracking, the government attempts to track and identify protesters through the phones' GPS.\n",
      "Human rights violations used by the IRI to intimidate and discourage protesters reportedly include use of  \"shotguns, assault rifles, and handguns against protesters in largely peaceful and often crowded settings\", resulting in the killing and injuring of hundreds (Human Rights Watch, based on videos, interviews with witnesses and a security force member);  forced confessions, threats to uninvolved family members, and torture, including electric shocks, controlled drowning, and mock execution (based on CNN interviews); sexual violence\n",
      "(according to testimony and social media videos, and several such accounts corroborated by a CNN investigation, including the case of a political dissident being brutally raped in custody), “systematic\" attempts using projectiles such as \"pellets, teargas canisters, paintball bullets\" \"to blind protesters by shooting at their eyes\" (activist media group IranWire documented at least 580 cases). Under the guise of rushing injured civilians to receive emergency medical attention, ambulances were used to transport security forces and kidnapped protesters.\n",
      "While this may seem brutal and inhumane to some, “in the mind of the regime, nothing is off limits because we’re doing God’s work,” according to scholar Borzou Daragahi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Communications blackouts ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Beginning on 19 September, the Iranian government has blocked access to specific Internet services and repeatedly shut down the Internet and cellphone partly and networks entirely, in order to prevent images and video of the protests from reaching a worldwide audience, and to hinder protesters from organizing effectively. According to Internet monitoring group NetBlocks, these are \"the most severe Internet restrictions since the November 2019 massacre\", when during the 2019–2020 protests the Internet was completely shut down for a week, and 1,500 protesters were killed by government forces. Outages during the current protests have been shorter and less widespread than the 2019 blackout, and are highly disruptive, but widely circumvented. Iranians have been hopping between services depending on what currently works.\n",
      "Despite the nationwide Internet blackouts, some videos of the events were distributed internationally. A small group of people from both inside and outside of Iran run the 1500tasvir Instagram account, which, as of October 2022, had over 450,000 followers. The group stated that on typical days they received more than 1,000 videos and published dozens. They posted video to their Twitter accounts. One member of the 1500tasvir team described the impact of Internet shutdowns as \"extraordinary\", and negatively impacting protests, saying that \"When you [can] ... see other people feel the same way, you get more brave\" but \"When the Internet is cut off ... you feel alone\". IranWire and Radio Zamaneh, exiled journalistic outlets, collect information from Iran and have had drastically increased Iranian online audiences since the protests began; they also broadcast by satellite.\n",
      "Prior to the protests, access to the Internet was already heavily restricted, in what NetBlocks calls a \"filternet\". Over five million websites were blocked. Many Internet domains were blocked. Social media were especially restricted: Facebook, Telegram, TikTok, and Twitter were all previously blocked after the 2009 post-election protests. These blocks are not entirely effective; Twitter is still widely used by Iranians, and Telegram is also used. Instagram and WhatsApp had been allowed and were popular in Iran (reportedly, 2 million Iranian businesses were on Instagram, and 70% of Iranian adults used WhatsApp), and early in the protests, they were only blocked regionally, being blocked only in Saqqez and Sanandaj for a few days beginning on the 19th of September. Beginning on 21 September, Instagram and WhatsApp were also blocked nationwide. Iranian state media has said the imposed restrictions are due to \"national security\" concerns. The blocking of WhatsApp was fairly effective, but Instagram remained very widely used despite the block. As of 24 September, access to Skype has reportedly been blocked. As of 29 September, the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, and LinkedIn have also been blocked.\n",
      "According to Foreign Policy magazine, Iran's National Information Network (NIN) (\"the most important weapon in the Islamic Republic’s communications arsenal\" and modeled on Russia's and China's intranet systems), gives the state \"the ability to control what people see, how they communicate, and the choices they make\", and has improved its capabilities from 2012 to 2023, with each round of protest.\n",
      "Many Iranians have used VPNs to bypass Internet filtering, hopping from one to another as they are blocked. VPNs are illegal in Iran, so providers act as a mafia with government connections. VPN service has been progressively downgraded. Tor Browser is also used. Psiphon is popular.\n",
      "It has also been reported that text messages are being filtered, and communications which mention Amini's name are blocked from delivery to the intended recipient. People began using end-to-end-encrypted instant messaging clients instead. WhatsApp stated that they are working to keep Iranian users connected and would not block Iranian phone numbers; it has successfully been blocked for much of the protests. Telegram is widely used, especially by activists and journalists, as is Signal. Signal asked the tech community and international volunteers to run proxy servers (to circumvent blocks on the Signal servers). Signal also published support documents in Persian. However, Signal has been hampered by Iranian blocking of SMS validation text codes that Signal attempts to send to its users.\n",
      "In addition to selectively blocking websites, the entire network has repeatedly been shut down and cut off from the world outside Iran. This is expensive; the cost was estimated at $37 million US a day. Multiple monitoring groups have documented rolling connectivity blackouts, affecting Iran's largest mobile carriers, with a \"curfew-style pattern of disruptions\" that lasts for 12 hours at a time. Internet speeds have also been throttled at times when people are on the streets, probably to prevent them from uploading videos. With the spread of demonstrations to over 80 cities across the country, the government repeatedly shut down mobile networks. As the protests wore on, increasingly only the 4G cellphone masts covering the areas of the protests were shut down, so that mobile data was not available to protesters.\n",
      "Satellite and direct peer-to-peer communications bypass blocked wire, fiber, and cellphone network hardware entirely. Satellite news broadcasts, such as London-based Farsi-language Iran International, provided updates on planned demonstrations. Jamming by the Iranian government was partially successful in blocking foreign satellite TV in parts of Iran. On 7 October, Eutelsat accused Iran of jamming two Persian-language broadcast satellites, in contravention of ITU rules. Toosheh is a satelltite data broadcast which uses satellite TV receiving equipment common in Iran. It can be used to download files, which are then sometimes sneakernetted, but it cannot be used to upload content. Starlink satellite uplinks require 30-pound (14 kg) ground stations, and a large clear space to place the antenna in, which makes them hard to import and hide. They are also difficult to set up.\n",
      "Iranians use mesh networks, including mobile ad-hoc networks, in which consumer computers and cellphones transmit data between one another directly (by radio: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth). However, the physical devices have to be close enough (within ~10 metres (33 ft)) to relay the data from one to another, so this is not useful for talking to the world outside Iran. Some activists distributed paper leaflets detailing planned protests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Response by regime supporters ===\n",
      "Aside from security forces, the regime is assisted by civilian hardline supporters of the Islamic Republic government who make up a minority of the population. A 2017 speech by Supreme Leader Khamenei is widely believed to have given his supporters/regime supporters \"extrajudicial powers\" referred to as atash be-ekhtiyar, or permission to \"fire at will\" against regime enemies. Civilian hardliners are valuable to the regime because they “will turn out on the street\" when the regime needs them and is willing to do unpopular or illegal deeds \"that the state doesn’t want to do” in attacking government opponents, giving the state \"plausible deniability\". But as an ideological group it is not totally obedient to the regime and must be \"catered to\", limiting the regime's ability to compromise.\n",
      "These supporters held counter-protests across several cities in Iran in response to the protests, which the Iranian government referred to as \"spontaneous\". The pro-government counter protesters called for the Mahsa Amini protesters to be executed, and referred to them as \"Israel's soldiers\" whilst shouting \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel\", reflecting Iran's clerical rulers' usual narrative that dissatisfaction with its rule is the result of foreign conspiracy not its own doing.\n",
      "As of mid-2023, vigilantism by the core of regime supporters was said to be \"on the rise\" with reports of \"armed men on motorbikes roamed the streets\" in the city of Rasht, ordering unveiled women to cover up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Government campaign for public opinion ===\n",
      "According to some sources (such as Vali Nasr), the government pitched a campaign to convince traditional supporters of the regime whose support was now wavering, propagandizing that the “'women, life, freedom' movement was part of a coördinated campaign to destabilize Iran\". “There was an amazing amount of sympathy among more conservative and regime-affiliated women for these girls and the arguments they were making,” according to Nasr. One effective piece messaging was “For the Girl Next Door”, an online video that tied together video clips of \"two decades of Afghan women’s suffering\" with that of U.S. presidents touting their success in combatting the Taliban and speculating how the U.S. might “free” Iran, all set to the anthem of the protests, “Baraye,” by the Iranian musician Shervin Hajipour.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lyrics warned the girls of Iran not to let themselves be similarly victimized by the West: “For you, the girl next door / don’t let your home get ruined like ours / don’t let your dreams become like our stories / don’t let war happen in your country.” \n",
      "Eventually, for the most part, the traditional supporters returned \"home\", and abandoned sympathy for the protests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Aftermath ==\n",
      "As of September 2023, Iranians are saying things like, \"the women of Iran have crossed the threshold of fear,\" and Iranian \"society won't go back to the pre-Mahsa time\" (film-maker Mojgan Ilanlou); but also that the government has \"dug its heels in\", (Jasmin Ramsey, deputy director of the New York-based NGO The Center for Human Rights in Iran). Others (Holly Dagres) insist the protests have continued but not been given the publicity they deserve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Lack of head covering ===\n",
      "According to the BBC News Caroline Hawley, behavior unthinkable before the death of Mahsa Amini is now commonplace as of August 2023 in at least Tehran:\n",
      "\n",
      "A young woman walks down a street in Tehran, her hair uncovered, her jeans ripped, a bit of midriff exposed to the hot Iranian sun. An unmarried couple walk hand in hand. A woman holds her head high when asked by Iran's once-feared morality police to put a hijab on, and tells them: \"Screw you!\"\n",
      "20% of women in Iran are now going out on to the streets without the veil, according to the estimate of a Western diplomat in Tehran. Another sources states the rebellion is \"a generational thing much more than a geographical thing\" and not limited to Tehran. \"It's not just your bright educated people, it's basically any young person with a smartphone … so that's what takes you right out into the villages, and all over.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Crackdown ====\n",
      "In the weeks and months after the protest started, observers often used the word \"revolution\" or \"regime change\" to describe the protests or what they might become.\n",
      "However, as of September 2023, a crackdown is in process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of punishments for women who disobey the dress code keeps intensifying. Hefty fines. Banking restrictions. Business closures. Jail time. Forced labor. Travel bans. Being diagnosed as mentally ill.\n",
      "In spring 2023, 150 cafés and shops \"were reportedly shuttered for failing to enforce the hijab law\". \n",
      "In mid-July, just before the start of the holy month of Muharram, a spokesman for Iranian law enforcement formally announced that the morality police would return to the streets, after being quietly removed for several months, (widespread internet outages were observed on July 15, the day of their returned to the streets). Punishment in Tehran for not wearing a head scarf was reportedly washing corpses in a morgue.\n",
      "21 September a \"Hijab and Chastity Bill\" passed Iran's parliament, calling for new punishments on women who go unveiled, including  prison terms of up to 10 years and fines of 500m-1bn rials ($11,800-$23,667) for \"'those who do not comply … in an organised way or encourage others to do so'\".\n",
      "Prior to the anniversary or Mahsa Amini's slaying, family members of Mahsa and of people killed protesting her death were arrested or threatened to stay off the street (according to Kurdistan Human Rights Network). Amini's father Amjad was reportedly detained by authorities. Military helicopters hovered over the Aichi cemetery where she was buried with military personnel and police stationed throughout the area, (according to IranWire).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Surveillance of protesters and dissidents ====\n",
      "Since the protests officials have expanded digital and video surveillance of the public and used footage of unveiled women to identify them and deny them services and impose fines.\n",
      "In potentially the first usage of facial recognition technology to enforce religious dress codes, some women involved in the protests have received hijab violation citations in the mail without any prior interaction with law enforcement officers. Iranian authorities may have trialed the technology as early as 2020, when women were sent warnings through SMS text if they were not wearing a hijab within motor vehicles.\n",
      "In late April, Alireza Zakani, the mayor of Tehran, announced that un-hijabed women attempting to use the metro would be issued warnings, and eventually prevented from entering stations. Transportation officials said unveiled women drivers would be detected by traffic-surveillance cameras and cars of repeat offenders impounded. Also around this time, a law was proposed in parliament that would impose a range of new penalties on women who defy the dress codes or advocate against them online, such as substantial fines and the “deprivation of social rights”.\n",
      "In August 2023 the government opened a website—Specialcommittee.ir—for the public to inform on protesters.\n",
      "Nonetheless, the regime is reportedly still reportedly trying to encourage compliance through persuasion and “cultural work”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Analysis ==\n",
      "In an analysis by Emily Blout, she finds that the protest's lack of success in bringing about the changes it demanded were not so much a matter of its mistakes as the regime's success, and that the regime drew on the lessons from its overthrew of the Shah, specifically his mistakes in trying to prevent revolution. Blout credits: \n",
      "\n",
      "the regime's decisive and unwavering repression of the protest, policy of crushing protest rather than meeting any of the \"calls for change\", Fighting as though the regime's \"life and livelihood depends upon it\", which Blout points out it did. Regime forces are well compensated and do not have the option of fleeing to Europe or America as the Shah's loyalists did.\n",

      "\n",
      "According to the BBC, as of November 2022, Western grassroots public opinion is strongly on the side of the protesters. For Western governments, the protests compete for priority with other issues such as Iranian nuclearization and Iranian arms shipments to Russia. Many international NGOs have explicitly condemned Iran's government for the violent crackdown, but the United Nations has declined to follow suit, instead limiting itself to statements of concern.\n",
      "Iranian authorities were defiant, President Ebrahim Raisi proclaimed that \"Enemies want to create a new sedition by riding the wave of livelihood and economic demands of the people; But people are alert and will not allow abuse while raising their demands\", and canceled an interview in New York with a CNN correspondent when she refused his last minute demand to wear hijab.\n",
      "On 24 September, the Foreign Ministry of Iran summoned the ambassadors of the UK and Norway, over of what it considered their \"interventionist stance\". In particular, the Iranian authorities protested the \"hostility\" allegedly created by Farsi-language London-based media outlets, as well as the statements made by Iranian-born president of the Norwegian parliament Masud Gharahkhani, in support of the protests.\n",
      "Iran has alleged that Kurdish groups in Iraq have supported the protests, and has launched attacks on Iraq's Kurdistan region. A 28 September drone and missile attack on an Iranian-Kurdish opposition group in Iraq killed at least 14, including an American and her newborn. The U.S. condemned the attack and threatened further sanctions against Iran. As of 5 October 2022, Iranian attacks (mainly artillery strikes) on Kurdish Iraq were still continuing.\n",

On 4 October, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EU was considering sanctions against Iran. By 7 October, Denmark, France, Germany, and Italy had called for EU sanctions against Iran.\n",
      " United Nations: UN Secretary-General António Guterres, on 27 September, issued a statement calling on Iranian security forces to \"refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force\". Nada al-Nashif, the acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, expressed concern over Amini's death and Iranian authorities' response to the resulting protests. Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the UN High Commission for Human Rights, urged Iran's clerical leadership several days later to \"fully respect the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, peaceful assembly, and association\". Shamdasani added that reports specify that \"hundreds have also been arrested, including human rights defenders, lawyers, civil society activists, and at least 18 journalists\", and \"Thousands have joined anti-government demonstrations throughout the country over the past 11 days. Security forces have responded at times with live ammunition\". On 22 November the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that more than 300 people including 40 minors have been killed so far by the Iranian government since the start of the protests; throughout the country and in 25 out of 31 of its provinces.\n",

These include Mohammad Rostami Cheshmeh Gachi, chief of Iran's Morality Police, and Kioumars Heydari, commander of the Iranian army's ground force, in addition to the Iranian Minister of Intelligence Esmaeil Khatib, Haj Ahmad Mirzaei, head of the Tehran division of the Morality Police, Salar Abnoush, deputy commander of the Basij militia, and two law enforcement commanders, Manouchehr Amanollahi and Qasem Rezaei of the Law Enforcement Command of Islamic Republic of Iran in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province. The sanctions would involve blocking any properties or interests in property within the jurisdiction of the U.S., and reporting them to the U.S. Treasury. Penalties would be imposed on any parties that facilitate transactions or services to the sanctioned entities. On 6 October, the U.S. sanctioned seven Iranian government officials involved with the protest crackdowns.\n",
      "On 26 September, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stated that his government would impose sanctions on the Morality Police, its leadership, and the officials responsible for Amini's death and the crackdown on the protesters. On 3 October, the sanctions became official when Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly announced sanctions targeting 9 entities, including the Morality Police and the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, and 25 individuals, that include high-ranking officials and members of the IRGC. These individuals include Mohammed-Hossein Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, IRGC Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami, and Esmail Qaani, commander of the Quds Force of the IRGC. On 7 October, the Canadian government expanded the sanctions, banning 10,000 members of the IRGC from entering the country permanently, which represents the top 50% of the organization's leadership. The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, stated that Canada planned to expand the sanctions against those most responsible for Iran's \"egregious behavior\". Canadian Deputy Prime Minister, Chrystia Freeland, stated that Iran was a \"state sponsor of terror\", and that \"it is oppressive, theocratic and misogynist; The IRGC leadership are terrorists, the IRGC is a terrorist organization\".\n",
      "On 10 October, the United Kingdom applied sanctions on Iranian officials with Foreign Secretary James Cleverly stating that the United Kingdom meant to \"send a clear message to the Iranian authorities — we will hold you to account for your repression of women and girls, and for the shocking violence you have inflicted on your own people.\" Also on 10 October, Deutsche Welle reported that the European Union was working behind the scenes to prepare a sanctions package against Iran. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock promised that the EU would issue travel bans and asset freezing against Iranian officials trying to suppress the protests. Bijan Djir-Sarai, spokesperson of the German Free Democratic Party, urged the organization to \"quickly adopt powerful sanctions that target the Iranian oligarchy\", including members of Iran's Morality Police, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and other loyalists of the Islamic regime, \"who are responsible for serious human rights violations\".\n",
      "On 13 October, Canada imposed new sanctions on Iran's government entities and seventeen government-affiliated figures, stating \"the actions of the Iranian regime speak for themselves – the world has watched for years as it has pursued its agenda of violence, fear and propaganda\" (...) Canada will continue to defend human rights and we will continue to stand in solidarity with the Iranian people, including women and youth, who are courageously demanding a future where their human rights will be fully respected.\" The figures listed include former foreign minister Javad Zarif, army general Amir Hatami, and Saeed Mortazavi, an Iranian prosecutor whom Canada holds accountable for the torture (and in turn, death) of Canadian-Iranian journalist Zahra Kazemi.\n",

Rekabi stated that the act was not intended to be symbolic, claiming publicly that she had been in a hurry and that her headscarf had fallen off accidentally. Human rights organisations and activists suggested that Rekabi had been coerced by the Iranian authorities.

      "Volcanism on Venus\n",
      "\n",
      "The surface of Venus is dominated by volcanic features and has more volcanoes than any other planet in the Solar System. It has a surface that is 90% basalt, and about 65% of the planet consists of a mosaic of volcanic lava plains, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. There are more than 1,000 volcanic structures and possible periodic resurfacing of Venus by floods of lava. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Venus has an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide, with a pressure that is 90 times that of Earth's atmosphere.\n",
      "There are over 80,000 volcanoes on Venus detected through radar mapping. For many years scientists debated on whether Venus was currently active or if the volcanic structures were remnants from the past. There are few impact craters on Venus' surface which pointed to relatively recent resurfacing. The most likely resurfacing event would have been volcanic flows. Radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. Although many lines of evidence such as this suggest that volcanoes on Venus have been recently active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, other more recent studies, in 2020, suggest that Venus, though not Maat Mons specifically, is indeed currently volcanically active. In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the Magellan orbiter. Using computer simulations they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause. Until 2023, there had only been hints of active volcanism. In March 2023, Herrick et al. announced that they had imaged a vent expanding in Magellan images, indicating active volcanism on Venus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Types of volcanoes ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Venus has shield volcanoes, widespread lava flows and some unusual volcanoes called pancake domes and \"tick-like\" structures which are not present on Earth. Pancake dome volcanoes are up to 15 km (9.3 mi) in diameter and less than 1 km (0.62 mi) in height and are 100 times larger than lava domes formed on Earth. They are usually associated with coronae and tesserae (large regions of highly deformed terrain, folded and fractured in two or three dimensions, which are unique to Venus). The pancakes are thought to be formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure.\n",
      "The \"tick-like\" structures are called scalloped margin domes. They are commonly called ticks because they appear as domes with numerous legs. They are thought to have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. Sometimes deposits of debris can be seen scattered around them.\n",
      "On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. The shield volcanoes, for example those in Hawaii, eject magma from the depths of the Earth in zones called hot spots. The lava from these volcanoes is relatively fluid and permits the escape of gases. Composite volcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates. In this type of volcano, the oceanic crust of one plate is sliding underneath the other in a subduction zone, together with an inflow of seawater, producing a gummier lava that restricts the exit of the gases, and for that reason, composite volcanoes tend to erupt more violently.\n",
      "On Venus, where there are no tectonic plates or seawater, volcanoes are mostly of the shield type. Nevertheless, the morphology of volcanoes on Venus is different: on Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometres wide and up to 10 km (6.2 mi) high in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometres in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of 1.5 km (0.93 mi). Large volcanoes cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward because of their enormous vertical loads, producing flexural moats or ring fractures around the edifices. Large volcano edifice loading also causes magma chambers to fracture in a sill-like pattern, affecting magma propagation beneath the surface.\n",
      "Other unique features of Venus's surface are novae (radial networks of dikes or grabens) and arachnoids. A nova is formed when large quantities of magma are extruded onto the surface to form radiating ridges and trenches which are highly reflective to radar. These dikes form a symmetrical network around the central point where the lava emerged, where there may also be a depression caused by the collapse of the magma chamber.\n",
      "Arachnoids are so named because they resemble a spider's web, featuring several concentric ovals surrounded by a complex network of radial fractures similar to those of a nova. It is not known whether the 250 or so features identified as arachnoids actually share a common origin, or are the result of different geological processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Recent volcanic activity ==\n",
      "Volcanism on Venus has taken place within the last 2.5 million years; however, until recently there had been no absolute proof that any volcano on Venus has erupted recently. Recent radar imagery shows more than 1,000 volcanic structures and evidence of possible periodic resurfacing of the planet by floods of lava. In addition to the radar images, there is supporting evidence that volcanism has taken place, including an unusual change in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas in the upper atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is an important component of volcanic outgassing. However, the sulphur dioxide in the lower atmosphere remains stable. This could mean that a change in the global atmosphere caused the sulphur dioxide concentration to increase above the clouds. Even though the change in the atmosphere may be evidence that there have been volcanoes that erupted in Venus, it is difficult to determine whether they occurred or not. In 2014, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was located, in the form of infrared \"flashes\" over the edges of rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Sapas Mons. These flashes were detectable during two or three consecutive Earth days in 2008 and 2009 and are thought to be caused either by hot gases or lava released from volcanic eruptions. Scientists suspect that there are four volcanoes that may be active: Maat Mons, Ozza Mons, Sapas Mons and Idunn Mons.\n",
      "In 2020, a study by University of Maryland supported by Swiss National Science Foundation and NASA discovered that 37 of Venus's coronae show signs of ongoing activity. Maryland professor Laurent Montesi said, \"we are able to point to specific structures and say 'Look, this is not an ancient volcano but one that is active today, dormant perhaps, but not dead...'\" The active coronae are clustered near each other, so positioning geologic survey instruments would now be easier.\n",
      "In March 2023, at the 54th Lunar Planetary Science Conference, a team revealed the first images of volcanic activity on the surface of Venus. The announcement consisted of two radar images from different cycles of Magellan data (8 months apart) that displayed a volcanic vent that had expanded by almost 2 square kilometers. This data was over 30 years old at the time of this discovery. The scientists checked that this expansion could not be explained by the angle at which the images were taken through computer simulations, which revealed that the change must be structural.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Lightning ===\n",
      "Lightning on Venus may serve as a diagnostic of volcanism or atmospheric convection, so some effort has been devoted to detecting possible lightning on Venus. No lightning has been directly observed, but the most compelling evidence is the very low frequency (VLF) radio emissions recorded beneath the clouds by all four of the Venera landers. The Japanese orbiter Akatsuki is currently searching for visible lightning on Venus, among other science objectives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Atmospheric phosphine ===\n",
      "In 2020, Greaves et al. detected phosphine levels of 1–5 parts per billion in Venus' atmosphere using ALMA and JCMT. Historic data from Pioneer Venus also shows the possible detection of phosphine. Phosphine (PH3) is derived from phosphide (P3-) through the following interaction with sulfuric acid in Venus' atmosphere:\n",
      "\n",
      "2 P3− + 3 H2SO4  →  2 PH3 + 3 SO2−4\n",
      "Phosphide comes from metals such as iron and magnesium, which should exist in great quantities in Venus' mantle. The phosphines were detected at a height of 70 km, which implies a volcanic eruption on the explosive scale of Krakatau or Yellowstone on Earth. The implication of this is not only that Venus has experienced recent volcanism, but that it is capable of explosive eruptions despite the lack of hydrated melts similar to those created at subduction zones on Earth. It is thought that Venus may have primordial water in the mantle that could be concentrated through fractionation.\n",
      "Biological activity has been suggested as an alternate explanation for the phosphines in Venus' atmosphere, but this is unlikely due to the absence of any other biosignatures. Another hypothesis states that the phosphine could be produced in Venus' clouds, but this process requires water which is generally unavailable on Venus. Some scientists question that the phosphine levels found are truly as high as indicated. If the phosphine is present in amounts of 1–5 ppb and can be determined to originate in the mantle, it will imply a deep mantle plume system which contains enough volatiles to produce explosive volcanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Exploration ===\n",
      "In 2010, Suzanne E. Smrekar et al. published that Venus Express observed three volcanoes that have had eruptions about 250,000 years ago or less, which suggests that Venus is periodically resurfaced by lava flows. She has proposed two missions to Venus to elucidate the planet: Venus Origins Explorer (VOX), and VERITAS. Meanwhile, the Japanese spacecraft Akatsuki has been orbiting Venus since December 2015 and one of its goals is to scan for active volcanism using its infrared cameras, although the infrared detector that was supposed to do this failed in December 2016 after a relatively short period of observations.\n",
      "Three missions are expected to launch in the 2030s, VERITAS, DAVINCI, and EnVision, all of which will help detect volcanism. Both VERITAS and EnVision will use radar remote sensing to map the surface of Venus at resolution 10 times better than that of Magellan. These missions will allow mapping over different time periods that could display more, higher resolution, evidence of current day volcanism.\n",
      "EnVision has the VenSAR (Venus Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument that will map down to 30 m resolution and even down to 1 m in select areas. The SRS (Subsurface Radar Sounder) will penetrate the surface up to a kilometer and receive signals back that can be used to describe the internal structures of the planet. This will help to learn about internal workings of volcanic structures. The Venus Emisivity Mapper (VEM) will map the surface in infrared wavelengths which when added to radar can describe the topography of the surface.\n",
      "DAVINCI will not be mapping the surface, but analyzing the atmosphere. The analysis of SO2 and other gasses will help to learn about out gassing from recent volcanoes. DAVINCI will have a probe that descends into the atmosphere collecting data along the way. Atmospheric analysis will provide important information to pair with the recent discovery of active volcanism.\n",
      "VERITAS will also have the Venus Emissivity Mapper (VEM) and a radar imager VISAR (Venus Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar). These will map lava fields and volcanoes on Venus' surface. Originally set to launch in 2027, this mission has been delayed until 2030. If VERITAS resumes its original launch date, the data between VERTIAS and EnVision will pair together similarly to the various cycles of Magellan data. They would then have the opportunity to view volcanic changes across a set of years.\n",

      "== Identifying volcanoes on Venus ==\n",
      "Locating volcanoes on Venus became possible during the Magellan mission in 1990, which mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. The surface of Venus is hidden by clouds but surface features can be mapped using synthetic aperture radar. Some images created by this mapping can give a perspective view of the elevation of the surface of Venus, which assists in the identification of volcanoes. Volcanic features discovered include flood lavas, edifice clusters, shield volcanoes, volcanic cones, and volcanic domes. Since the Magellan mission, more than 1,660 volcanic landforms have been identified on the surface of Venus. Further analysis of the Magellan data revealed more than 85,000 volcanoes.\n",
      "After the surface of Venus was mapped, the California Institute of Technology created an algorithm for automatically identifying volcanoes from the mapping images. Certainty that all the identified features are volcanoes is not possible but a system of categories was developed that label the confidence of whether a surface feature is a volcano or not. The algorithm examines images of a 30 km × 30 km area of the surface of Venus and areas considered to be volcanoes are reshaped into a vector and processed through a series of equations. This algorithm has been used to identify multiple volcanoes in different mapping images from Venus.\n",
      "Scientists are also able to determine the age of volcanoes on Venus using images from the Magellan mission, for example by examining wrinkle ridges on regional plains; if the flanking slopes of a volcano do not have wrinkles ridges, then they would be considered young.\n",

Based on the mapping of the volcano, the area around the central caldera is mostly flat with many chain pits surrounding the area. On eastern parts of the volcano, lava has flooded from the main caldera to smaller calderas nearby. Evidence suggests that there were many flank eruptions at this volcano. Most of the flow fields around this volcano are sheet flow fields.\n",

      "Pandemic prevention is the organization and management of preventive measures against pandemics. Those include measures to reduce causes of new infectious diseases and measures to prevent outbreaks and epidemics from becoming pandemics.\n",
      "It is not to be mistaken for pandemic preparedness or mitigation (e.g. against COVID-19) which largely seek to mitigate the magnitude of negative effects of pandemics, although the topics may overlap with pandemic prevention in some respects.\n",
      "Some biosafety and public health researchers contend that certain pandemic prevention efforts themselves carry risk of triggering pandemics (e.g. wildlife virus sampling), though not engaging in any form of sampling also carries the risk of being unprepared for future spillover events and being unaware of future pandemic pathogens.\n",

      "=== 2002–2004 SARS outbreak ===\n",
      "During the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV-1 virus was prevented from causing a pandemic of Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the World Health Organization helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. Human-to-human transmission of SARS may be considered eradicated, however, it could re-emerge as SARS-CoV-1 probably persists as a potential zoonotic threat in its original animal reservoir. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia. Effective isolation of patients was enough to control spread because infected individuals usually do not transmit the virus until several days after symptoms begin and are most infectious only after developing severe symptoms.\n",

      "=== MERS-CoV/NeoCoV alert ===\n",
      "In January 2022, Chinese scientists at the Wuhan University and other institutions reported in a preprint the detection of the closest MERS-CoV relative in bats to date, NeoCoV, and another virus, PDF-2180-CoV, that can efficiently use bats' ACE2 for cell entry. The study, now published in Nature found that one mutation could result in a theoretical 'MERS-CoV-2' that, like SARS-CoV-2, can use humans' ACE2 receptor. The theoretical virus could also have a high mortality burden, since MERS-CoV had a case fatality rate of around 35%. This 'MERS-CoV-2' therefore represents a risk to biosafety and potential zoonotic spillover. The study emphasized the need for pathogen/spillover surveillance to further understand any possible threat from related viruses. The WHO stated that further study is needed to find out \"whether the virus detected in the study will pose a risk for humans\".\n",

The first of these cases was detected on 6 May 2022. The main method used for early containment (see below) is 'ring vaccination' – vaccinating close contacts of positive cases via already-existing vaccines alongside pre-exposure vaccination of members of the public at higher risk.\n",

      "Robust, collaborating public health systems that have the capacity for active surveillance for early detection of cases and to mobilize their health care coordination capacity may be required to be able stop contagion promptly. After an outbreak there is a certain window of time during which a pandemic can still be stopped by the competent authorities isolating the first infected and/or fighting the pathogen. A good global infrastructure, consequent information exchange, minimal delays due to bureaucracy and effective, targeted treatment measures can be prepared. In 2012 it has been proposed to consider pandemic prevention as an aspect of international development in terms of health-care infrastructure and changes to the pathogen-related dynamics between humans and their environment including animals. Often local authority carers or doctors in Africa, Asia or Latin America register uncommon accumulations (or clusterings) of symptoms but lack options for more detailed investigations. Scientists state that \"research relevant to countries with weaker surveillance, lab facilities and health systems should be prioritized\" and that \"in those regions, vaccine supply routes should not rely on refrigeration, and diagnostics should be available at the point of care\". Two researchers have suggested that public health systems \"in each country\" need to be capable of detecting contagion early, diagnosing it accurately, implementing effective disease control measures, and fully collaborating with the relevant international authorities at each stage (see below). U.S. officials have proposed a range of reforms to international health regulations and global institutions for global health security. The \"entire architecture of the response to epidemics\" may need to get adapted, evolving \"from crisis response during discrete outbreaks to an integrated cycle of preparation, response and recovery\" (see also #International coordination).\n",

No SARS-CoV-2 related viruses could be found in any samples collected in China, including from the only two domestic caves where RaTG13 and RmYN02 were detected, indicating such viruses may currently not circulate in bats in the country. A study of wild animals sampled in and around Wuhan at the beginning of COVID-19 emergence did not find SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor virus in these samples. However, a virologist noted that their \"sample sizes are not large enough\" – 334 bats instead of \"tens of thousands of bats\". While another study claims to have used \"more than 17,000 bats\" without finding SARS-CoV-2 relatives, a conservation biologist – who worked on a study that \"found four viruses related to SARS-CoV-2\" in 342 bat samples of a Yunnan garden – does not believe the study as does one of his coauthors, an evolutionary biologist.\n",

      "Efforts of pandemic prevention and related endeavors reportedly risk triggering pandemics themselves as of 2021. These risk include, but are not limited to, unwitting laboratory escape and accidents such as spillovers during field interventions/experiments like field collection, and misuse of its results due to e.g. insecure commercial sales of required equipment and/or materials and/or data.\n",
      "One approach to mitigate risks from pandemic prevention is to \"maintain a database with hashes of deadly and dangerous sequences\" which don't contain data with a potential for danger (depending on various factors) and also \"can't be reverse-engineered to learn the dangerous original sequence if you don't already know it\". This would theoretically enable checking sequences against a database of recorded pathogens without maintaining a database of deadly sequences. Another approach is not building such databases or not collecting dangerous sequences in the first place. A 2014 study proposed safer \"alternatives to experiments with novel potential pandemic pathogens\" than some of the current methods.\n",

      "In a 2012 study it is claimed that \"new mathematical modelling, diagnostic, communications, and informatics technologies can identify and report hitherto unknown microbes in other species, and thus new risk assessment approaches are needed to identify microbes most likely to cause human disease\". The study investigates challenges in moving the global pandemic strategy from response to pre-emption. Some scientists are screening blood samples from wildlife for new viruses. The international Global Virome Project (GVP) aims to identify the causes of fatal new diseases before emergence in human hosts by genetically characterizing viruses found in wild animals. The project aims to enlist an international network of scientists to collect hundreds of thousands of viruses, map their genomes, characterize and risk-stratify them to identify which ones to pay attention to. However, some infectious disease experts have criticized the project as too broad and expensive due to limited global scientific and financial resources and because only a small percentage of the world's zoonotic viruses may cross into humans and pose a threat. They argue for prioritizing rapidly detecting diseases when they cross into humans and an improving the understanding of their mechanisms. A successful prevention of a pandemic from specific viruses may also require ensuring that it does not re-emerge – for instance by sustaining itself in domestic animals.\n",
      "Pathogen detection mechanisms may allow the construction of an early warning system which could make use of artificial intelligence surveillance and outbreak investigation. Edward Rubin notes that after sufficient data has been gathered artificial intelligence could be used to identify common features and develop countermeasures and vaccines against whole categories of viruses. It might be possible to predict viral evolution using machine learning. In April 2020 it was reported that researchers developed a predictive algorithm which can show in visualizations how combinations of genetic mutations can make proteins highly effective or ineffective in organisms – including for viral evolution for viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In 2021, pathogen researchers reported the development of machine learning models for genome-based early detection and prioritization of high-risk potential zoonotic viruses in animals prior to spillover to humans which could be used for virus surveillance for (i.a.) measures of \"early investigation and outbreak preparedness\" and, according to the study, would have been capable of predicting SARS-CoV-2 as a high-risk strain without prior knowledge of zoonotic SARS-related coronaviruses.\n",
      "An artificial \"global immune system\"-like technological system that includes pathogen detection may be able to substantially reduce the time required to take on a biothreat agent. A system of that sort would also include a network of well-trained epidemiologists who could be rapidly deployed to investigate and contain an outbreak.\n",
      "Funding for the United States' PREDICT government research program that sought to identify animal pathogens that might infect humans and to prevent new pandemics was cut in 2019. Funding for United States' CDC programs that trained workers in outbreak detection and strengthened laboratory and emergency response systems in countries where disease risks are greatest to stop outbreaks at the source was cut by 80% in 2018.\n",
      "In 2022, researchers reported the development of an ultra-high-throughput sequence alignment technology that enables searching the planetary collection of nucleic acid sequences. The open source supercomputing-based Serratus Project identified over 130,000 RNA-based viruses, including 9 coronaviruses. While such and related endeavors and data are reportedly risky themselves as of 2021, the project aims to improve pathogen surveillance, the understanding of viral evolutionary origins and enable quickly connecting strange emerging illnesses to recorded viruses.\n",

      "==== CRISPR-based immune subsystems ====\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2020 scientists of Stanford University presented a CRISPR-based system, called PAC-MAN (Prophylactic Antiviral Crispr in huMAN cells), that can find and destroy viruses in vitro. However, they weren't able to test PAC-MAN on the actual SARS-CoV-2, use a targeting-mechanism that uses only a very limited RNA-region, haven't developed a system to deliver it into human cells and would need a lot of time until another version of it or a potential successor system might pass clinical trials. In the study published as a preprint they write that it could be used prophylactically as well as therapeutically. The CRISPR-Cas13d-based system could be agnostic to which virus it's fighting so novel viruses would only require a small change. In an editorial published in February 2020 another group of scientists claimed that they have implemented a flexible and efficient approach for targeting RNA with CRISPR-Cas13d which they have put under review and propose that the system can be used to also target SARS-CoV-2 in specific. There have also been earlier successful efforts in fighting viruses with CRISPR-based technology in human cells. In March 2020 researchers reported that they have developed a new kind of CRISPR-Cas13d screening platform for effective guide RNA design to target RNA. They used their model to predict optimized Cas13 guide RNAs for all protein-coding RNA-transcripts of the human genome's DNA. Their technology could be used in molecular biology and in medical applications such as for better targeting of virus RNA or human RNA. Targeting human RNA after it's been transcribed from DNA, rather than DNA, would allow for more temporary effects than permanent changes to human genomes. The technology is made available to researchers through an interactive website and free and open source software and is accompanied by a guide on how to create guide RNAs to target the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome.\n",
      "Scientists report to be able to identify the genomic pathogen signature of all 29 different SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences available to them using machine learning and a dataset of 5000 unique viral genomic sequences. They suggest that their approach can be used as a reliable real-time option for taxonomic classification of novel pathogens.\n",

      "\n",
      "==== Testing and containment ====\n",
      "\n",
      "Timely use and development of quick testing systems for novel virus in combination with other measures might (possibly) make it possible to end transmission lines of outbreaks before they become pandemics. After an outbreak there may be a certain window of time during which a pandemic can still be prevented. A key difficulty with early detection and containment is that in the globalized and urbanized world, pathogens can spread rapidly to several regions worldwide via travel, before it may be possible to notice them and e.g. initiate contact-tracing and containment measures. Rapid communication of data for health systems to implement any public intervention measures may be important. A \"'One Health' global network for proactive surveillance, rapid detection, and prevention of MERS-CoV and other epidemic infectious diseases threats\" has been proposed in 2016.\n",
      "Moreover, there are several issues with tests. For example, a high discovery-rate is important. For instance, this is the reason why no thermal scanners with a low discovery-rate were used in airports for containment during the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Coverage may also be important. (See also: pooled COVID-19 populations testing, possibly based on CRISPR) Wastewater surveillance likely cannot replace large-scale diagnostic testing, but could \"complement clinical surveillance by providing early signs of potential transmission for more active public health responses\".\n",
      "Some argue that the best forms of prevention for natural nonsynthetic viruses would be stopping the viruses from spilling into humans in the first place, rather than trying to contain outbreaks.\n",
      "The German program InfectControl 2020 seeks to develop strategies for prevention, early recognition and control of infectious diseases. In one of its projects \"HyFly\" partners of industry and research work on strategies to contain chains of transmission in air traffic, to establish preventive countermeasures and to create concrete recommendations for actions of airport operators and airline companies. One approach of the project is to detect infections without molecular-biological methods during passenger screening. For this researchers of the Fraunhofer-Institut for cell therapy and immunology are developing a non-invasive procedure based on ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS).\n",
      "Incentives for countries to report new viruses may be important for sufficiently fast detection and for avoiding cover-ups. A global treaty proposed by the E.U. could address this issue. Rapid regional, possibly also national, capacities in terms of e.g. means, mobile laboratories or diagnostics, personnel, technologies, financial insurances and coordination may also be important.\n",
      "In cases where vaccines already exist a major method for early containment is 'ring vaccination' – vaccinating close contacts of positive cases (and/or geographical areas) via existing vaccines as well as pre-exposure vaccination of people at higher risk. There are also precautionary vaccine stockpiles. Production capacities may also be important. See also: vaccine-to-variant adjustment for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron\n",
      "Researchers have developed a portable virus capture device, coupled with label-free Raman spectroscopy for identification of newly emerging or circulating viruses as a major first step toward managing the public health response to potential outbreaks. It could rapidly obtain the Raman signature of a virus and use machine learning to recognize the virus based on its weighted combination Raman spectrum fingerprint, being able to distinguish between influenza virus type A versus type B.\n",

      "===== Viral hotspots and zoonotic genomics =====\n",
      "Monitoring people who are exposed to animals in viral hotspots – including via virus monitoring stations – can register viruses at the moment they enter human populations - this might enable prevention of pandemics. The most important transmission pathways often vary per underlying driver of emerging infectious diseases such as the vector-borne pathway and direct animal contact for land-use change – the leading driver for emerging zoonoses by number of emergence events as defined by Jones et al. (2008). 75% of the reviewed 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans account for zoonoses by 2001. Genomics could be used to precisely monitor virus evolution and transmission in real time across large, diverse populations by combining pathogen genomics with data about host genetics and about the unique transcriptional signature of infection. The \"Surveillance, Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System\" (SORMAS) of the German Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung (HZI) and Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung (DZIF), who collaborate with Nigerian researchers, gathers and analyzes data during an outbreak, detects potential threats and allows to initiate protective measures early. It's meant specifically for poorer regions and has been used for the fight against a monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria.\n",

      "===== Syndromic surveillance and border control =====\n",
      "Expert on infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Amesh Adalja states that the most immediate way to predict a pandemic is with deeper surveillance of symptoms that fit the virus' profile. The scientific and technological ways of quickly detecting a spillover could be improved so that an outbreak can be isolated before it becomes an epidemic or pandemic. David Quammen states that he heard about the idea to develop technology to screen people at airport security points for whether or not they carry an infectious disease ten years ago and thought it was going to be done by now. Thermometers whose measurement data is directly shared via the Internet and medical guidance apps have been used to plot and map unusual fever levels to detect anomalous outbreaks. Various forms of data-sharing could be added to health care institutions such as hospitals so that e.g. anonymized data about symptoms and incidences found to be unusual or characteristic of a pandemic threat could enable high-resolution \"syndromic surveillance\" as an early warning system. In 1947, the World Health Organization established such a global network of some hospitals. Such sharing and off-site evaluation of symptoms and possibly related medical data may have complementary benefits such as improving livelihoods of workers who work with livestock and improving the accuracy, timeliness and costs of disease prognoses. The WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence is an early-warning center that attempts to aggregate data and quickly analyze it to predict, prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks and was set up Berlin in September 2021. It uses machine learning and may analyze data about animal health, unusual symptoms in humans, migration and other related developments that may contain detectable patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== Mutation surveillance =====\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, national and international officials reported mutated variants of SARS-CoV-2, including some with higher transmissibility and worldwide spread. While mutations are common for viruses and the spread of some of the virus' mutations have been tracked earlier, mutations that make it more transmittable or severe can be problematic. Resources for disease surveillance have improved during the pandemic so that medical systems around the world are starting to be equipped to detect such mutations with genomic surveillance in a manner relevant to pandemic mitigation and the prevention of sub-pandemics of specific variants or types of variants. As of December 2020, contemporary measures such as COVID-19 vaccines and medications seem to be effective in the treatment of infections with the tracked mutated variants compared to earlier forms that are closer to the original virus/es. Tools used in the pandemized outbreak of COVID-19 included PANGOLIN and Nextstrain. In July 2021, scientists reported the detection of anomalous unnamed unknown-host SARS-CoV-2 lineages via wastewater surveillance.\n",
      "Genomic surveillance refers to monitoring pathogens and analyzing their genetic similarities and differences, which may enable (early) alerts and tailoring interventions, countermeasures and recommendations for the public, like vaccines. In terms of pandemic prevention, it may be especially useful for vaccine-preventable diseases. A problem with the surveillance for mutated variants during the COVID-19 pandemic was that entities don't have sufficient incentives (and/or requirements) to report such variants. A global treaty proposed by the E.U. includes such incentives. A further issue was that vaccines did not provide a high enduring protection against the variants. One approach to solve this problem are pan-virus vaccines that protect against many strains (in this case a pan-SARS-CoV-2-like/variant-coronavirus vaccine), possibly including variants that do not yet exist.\n",

      "=== Policy and economics ===\n",
      "\n",
      "A 2014 analysis asserts that \"the window of opportunity to deal with pandemics as a global community is within the next 27 years. Pandemic prevention therefore should be a critical health policy issue for the current generation of scientists and policymakers to address. A 2007 study warns that \"the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. The possibility of the reemergence of SARS and other novel viruses from animals or laboratories and therefore the need for preparedness should not be ignored\". The US' National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which worked on preparing for the next disease outbreak and preventing it from becoming an epidemic or pandemic, was closed in 2018. A study concluded that the three practical actions \"better surveillance of pathogen spillover and development of global databases of virus genomics and serology, better management of wildlife trade, and substantial reduction of deforestation\" would have a highly favorable cost-benefit ratio. A second study affirms that if policy priorities were refocused from disease control to prevention, implementing such proactive actions would \"cost a very small fraction of the reconstruction budgets\".\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== Climate change =====\n",
      "\n",
      "The WHO projects that climate change will also affect infectious disease occurrence. It is projected that interspecies viral sharing, that can lead to novel viral spillovers, will increase due to ongoing climate change-caused geographic range-shifts of mammals (most importantly bats). Risk hotspots would mainly be located at \"high elevations, in biodiversity hotspots, and in areas of high human population density in Asia and Africa\". A 2016 study reviews literature on the evidences for the impact of climate change on human infectious disease, suggests a number of proactive measures for controlling health impacts of climate change and finds that climate change impacts human infectious disease via alterations to pathogen, host and transmission.\n",
      "Another way climate change may affect pandemic risks, is by pathogens in thawing permafrost (e.g. in the Arctic) that may have infected now-extinct ancestral humans in such regions. However, a scientist concluded that probably permafrost per se shouldn't host more pathogens than any other environment. Nevertheless, the risk from permafrost pathogens is unknown and viruses from the very first humans to populate the Arctic could emerge. Moreover, researchers have suggested more work on microbes soon to be released from melting glaciers across the world to identify and understand potential threats in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "===== Ecosystem degradation and consumption =====\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies have shown that the risk of disease outbreaks can increase substantially after forests are cleared. The likelihood of human-nonhuman primates contact events is increased jointly by forest landscape fragmentation and certain smallholders' behaviors in forest patches. A study identified the mechanistic connections among habitat loss, climate, and increased bat virus spillover risk. Loss of biodiversity may remove natural regulation of viruses and make fleeing animals meet other species for the first time. According to Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at University College London, the disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, resulting in transmission of diseases from wildlife to humans. An August 2020 study published in Nature concludes that the anthropogenic destruction of ecosystems for the purpose of expanding agriculture and human settlements reduces biodiversity and allows for smaller animals such as bats and rats, who are more adaptable to human pressures and also carry the most zoonotic diseases, to proliferate. This in turn can result in more pandemics. In October 2020, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published its report on the 'era of pandemics' by 22 experts in a variety of fields, and concluded that anthropogenic destruction of biodiversity is paving the way to the pandemic era, and could result in as many as 850,000 viruses being transmitted from animals – in particular birds and mammals – to humans. The increased pressure on ecosystems is being driven by the \"exponential rise\" in consumption and trade of commodities such as meat, palm oil, and metals, largely facilitated by developed nations, and by a growing human population. According to Peter Daszak, the chair of the group who produced the report, \"there is no great mystery about the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, or of any modern pandemic. The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment.\"\n",
      "Stanford biological anthropologist James Holland Jones notes that humanity has \"engineer[ed] a world where emerging infectious diseases are both more likely and more likely to be consequential\", referring to the modern world's prevalent highly mobile lifestyles, increasingly dense cities, various kinds of human interactions with wildlife and alterations of the natural world. Furthermore, when multiple species that are not usually next to each other are driven to live closely together new diseases may emerge. Research shows that abundant animals, plants, insects, and microbes living in complex, mature ecosystems can limit the spread of disease from animals to people. The United Nations is formulating nature-focused action plans that could help to stop the next pandemic before it starts. These strategies include conserving ecosystems and wilderness that are still untouched by human activity, and restoring and protecting significant areas of land and ocean (i.e. through protected areas). Protected areas (which may hold wildlife) also limits human presence and/or limits the exploitation of resources (including non-timber forest products such as game animals, fur-bearers, ...). An article by the World Economic Forum states that studies have shown that deforestation and loss of wildlife cause increases in infectious diseases and concludes that the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic should be linked to nature recovery, which it considers economically beneficial.\n",
      "Dennis Caroll of the Global Virome Project stated that the \"extractive industry — oil and gas and minerals, and the expansion of agriculture, especially cattle\" are the biggest predictors of where spillovers can be seen.

      "\n",
      "In a paywalled article, American scientists proposed policy-based measures to reduce large risks from life sciences research – including pandemics through accident or misapplication. Risk management measures may include novel international guidelines and standards of conduct, effective oversight, improvement of US policies to influence policies globally, and identification of gaps in biosecurity policies along with potential approaches to address them.\n",
      "Concerning systematic comprehensive identification of challenges, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) convened policy-makers and academics to identify challenges for the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 2017. A key issue identified was that the rapid rate of progress in relevant sciences and technologies has made it very difficult for governance bodies including the BWC to keep pace. Luke Kemp, a member of CSER, notes that \"just a few key countries [are] blocking regulation of catastrophic hazards\" and that \"[f]or biological weapons it was the US who was the primary culprit in preventing the adoption of a global verification scheme under the Biological Weapons Convention\" and suggests that \"attempts at regulation are often delayed, distorted or destroyed\".\n",
      "A 2021 Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) report concluded that \"[t]he international system for governing dual-use biological research is neither prepared to meet today’s security requirements, nor is it ready for significantly expanded challenges in the future\". Toby Ord, author of the book The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity which addresses the issue, puts into question whether current public health and international conventions, and self-regulation by biotechnology companies and scientists are adequate. As of 2017, there is \"no concerted international approach to identify, collect, analyze, and disseminate lessons and best practices in strengthening the organizational culture of life sciences research laboratories worldwide\" in terms of biosafety, biosecurity, and responsible conduct, albeit a number of international treaties and partnerships do exist. Around 2022, the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science (IBBIS) was set up by the NTI to improve biosecurity and biosafety, calling i.a. for tighter controls on custom-order DNA companies.\n",

      "In the context of the 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic Neal Baer writes that the \"public, scientists, lawmakers, and others\" \"need to have thoughtful conversations about gene editing now\". Ensuring the biosafety level of laboratories may also be an important component of pandemic prevention. This issue may have gotten additional attention in 2020 after news outlets reported that U.S. State Department cables indicate that, although there may be no conclusive proof at the moment, the COVID-19 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic may, possibly, have accidentally come from a Wuhan (China) laboratory, studying bat coronaviruses that included modifying virus genomes to enter human cells, and determined to be unsafe by U.S. scientists in 2018, rather than from a natural source. As of 18 May 2020, an official UN investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 virus, supported by over 120 countries, was being considered. United States' president Donald Trump claimed to have seen evidence that gave him a \"high degree of confidence\" that the novel coronavirus originated in the Chinese laboratory but did not offer any evidence, data or details, contradicted statements by the United States' intelligence community and garnered a lot of harsh criticism and doubts. As of 5 May, assessments and internal sources from the Five Eyes nations indicated that the coronavirus outbreak being the result of a laboratory accident was \"highly unlikely\", since the human infection was \"highly likely\" a result of natural human and animal interaction. Many others have also criticized statements by US government officials and theories of laboratory release. Virologist and immunologist Vincent R. Racaniello said that \"accident theories – and the lab-made theories before them – reflect a lack of understanding of the genetic make-up of Sars-CoV-2.\" Virologist Peter Daszak stated that an estimated 1–7 million people in Southeast Asia who live or work in proximity to bats are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. In January 2021, the WHO's investigations into the origin of COVID-19 was launched. In early 2021, the hypothesis of a laboratory cause of the pandemic received renewed interest and expert consideration due to renewed media discussion.\n",

      "Martin Rees, author of the book Our Final Hour which also addresses this issue, states that while better understanding of viruses may allow for an improved capability to develop vaccines it may also lead to an increase in \"the spread of 'dangerous knowledge' that would enable mavericks to make viruses more virulent and transmissible than they naturally are\". Different accelerations and priorizations of research may however be critical to pandemic prevention. A multitude of factors shape which knowledge about viruses with different use-cases, including vaccine-development, can be used by whom. Rees also states that \"the global village will have its village idiots, and they will have global range\".\n",
      "Experts have clarified that, for example, the definition of \"dual use\" is not well known and that the international community should better engage with the DIY bio community or biohacker students and in a way that does not stifle \"localised innovation for peaceful purposes or people wanting to learn about biology\". As of 2022, only very few sophisticated centers could recreate SARS-CoV-2 However, for example the progress in genetic engineering enabled all the tools needed to create a virus to be \"cheap, simple, and readily available\".\n",
      "94% of countries have no national-level oversight measures for dual-use research.\n",

      "\n",
      "In January 2020 during the SARS-CoV 2 outbreak experts in and outside China warned that wild animal markets, where the virus originated from, should be banned worldwide. Some scientists point out that banning informal wet markets worldwide isn't the appropriate solution as fridges aren't available in many places and because much of the food for Africa and Asia is provided through such traditional markets. Some also caution that simple bans may force traders underground, where they may pay less attention to hygiene and some state that it's wild animals rather than farmed animals that are the natural hosts of many viruses. National Geographic's Jonathan Kolby cautions about the risks and vulnerabilities present in the massive legal wildlife trade. Helping ensure people are provided with viable and profitable alternatives to the wildlife trade is also important.\n",
      "Some traditional medicines (i.e. traditional African medicine, TCM) still use animal-based substances. Since these can trigger zoonosis, a possible prevention could be changes to handbooks for practitioners of such traditional medicines (i.e. exclusion of animal-based substances). Senior adviser and veterinary epidemiologist at the National Food Institute at the Technical University of Denmark Ellis-Iversen states that in agricultural animal health \"outbreaks of exotic disease in well-regulated countries rarely get big because we identify and control them right away\". New York City's Bronx Zoo's head veterinarian Paul Calle states that usually emerging infectious diseases from animals are the result from wildlife consumption and distribution on a commercial scale rather than a lone person hunting to feed their family.\n",
      "UN biodiversity chief, bipartisan lawmakers, experts and scientists have called for a global ban of wetmarkets and wildlife trade. On January 26 China banned the trade of wild animals until the end of the coronavirus epidemic at the time. On February 24 China announced a permanent ban on wildlife trade and consumption with some exceptions. In early 2022 it was reported that the E.U. \"is pushing for a global deal aimed at preventing new pandemics that could include a ban [a gradual shutdown] on wildlife markets\".\n",

      "\n",
      "The Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) a network of countries, international organizations, NGOs and companies that aim to improve the world's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases. Sixty-seven countries have signed onto the GHSA framework. Funding for the GHSA has been reduced since the launch in 2014, both in the US and globally. The 194 WHO member states agreed in December 2021 to begin negotiations on the International Treaty on Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response. On the 2021 Global Health Summit, the G20 communicated to commit to promote a set of principles in the Rome Declaration. The new financial intermediary fund (FIF) for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response (PPR) was officially established by in September 2022, hosted by the World Bank with technical leadership from WHO.\n",
      "In a 2018 lecture in Boston Bill Gates called for a global effort to build a comprehensive pandemic preparedness and response system. During the COVID-19 pandemic he called upon world leaders to \"take what has been learned from this tragedy and invest in systems to prevent future outbreaks\". In a 2015 TED Talk he warned that \"if anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war\". Numerous prominent, authoritative, expert or otherwise influential figures have similarly warned about elevated, underprepared or contemporary risks of pandemics and the need for efforts on an \"international scale\" long before 2015 and since at least 1988. Later warnings include a 2015 study which concluded that \"a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations\". Unlike for climate change, which is by now \"widely agreed to be among the world's most important problems\", there are no large social movements dedicated to solving pandemic prevention.\n",
      "Some have provided suggestions for organizational or coordinative preparedness for pandemic prevention including a mechanism by which many major economic powers pay into a global insurance fund which \"could compensate a nation for economic losses if it acts quickly to close areas to trade and travel in order to stop a dangerous outbreak at its source\" or, similarly, sovereign or regional-level epidemic-insurance policies. International collaboration including cooperative research and information-sharing has also been considered vital.\n",
      "As an example of domestic coordination, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein called for the creation of a new interagency government entity, the Center for Combating Infectious Disease which would combine analytical and operational functions \"to oversee all aspects of preventing, detecting, monitoring, and responding to major outbreaks such as coronavirus\" and get provided with data and expertise by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. has also set up a \"Global Zoonotic Disease Task Force\" who would help \"ensure an integrated approach to preventing, detecting, preparing for, and responding to zoonotic spillover\". However, \"global preparedness is greater than the sum of national preparedness\" and lacks concerted, collective and coordinated action.\n",
      "John Davenport advises to abandon widespread libertarian ideology which, according to him, \"denies the importance of public goods or refuses to recognize their scope\". According to the CDC, investing in global health security and improving the organization's ability to prevent, detect, and respond to diseases could protect the health of American citizens as well as avert catastrophic costs. Dennis Carroll argues for a \"marriage\" between scientific discovery and political decision-making and policy formulation. Strengthened global governance – using facts, data, and science – with an emphasis on transparency and accountability and independent monitoring are important.\n",
      "A study found there to be a need \"for a renewed framework for global collective action that ensures conformity with international regulations and promotes effective prevention and response to pandemic infectious diseases\" and recommended \"greater authority for a global governing body, an improved ability to respond to pandemics, an objective evaluation system for national core public health capacities, more effective enforcement mechanisms, independent and sustainable funding, representativeness, and investment from multiple sectors, among others\". Researchers found \"a leader-level global council\" to be required \"to identify gaps in preparedness and response, mobilize finances, hold public and private stakeholders accountable, and provide leadership at the first hint of a threat\", including \"faster detection and reporting of outbreaks and threats\" by a more independent and better financed World Health Organization.\n",
      "Proposed novel organizations also include an entity or entities tasked with \"reducing the risk of catastrophic events due to accidents or deliberate abuse of bioscience and biotechnology\". (see above)\n",

      "Outbreaks could be contained or delayed – to enable other containment-measures – or prevented by artificial induction of immunity and/or biocides in combination with other measures that include prediction or early detection of infectious human diseases.\n",
      "Broad-spectrum antimicrobials, rapid antibody or drug development, development platforms, and quick drug repurposing and medication provisioning may also be potential ways to prevent outbreak from becoming pandemics. In FY2016, DARPA initiated the Pandemic Prevention Platform (P3) program aimed at the \"rapid discovery, testing, and manufacture of antibody treatments to fight any emerging disease threat\". The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant escaped the majority of existing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, including of sera from vaccinated and convalescent individuals.\n",

      "\n",
      "Development and provision of new vaccines usually takes years. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which was launched in 2017, works on reducing the time of vaccine-development. The Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT) is a public-private partnership fund which involves a national government, a UN agency, a consortium of pharmaceutical and diagnostics companies, and international philanthropic foundations to accelerate the creation of new vaccines, drugs and diagnostic tools for global health. It is unclear whether vaccines can play a role in pandemic prevention alongside pandemic mitigation. Nathan Wolfe proposes that pathogen detection and prediction may allow establishing viral libraries before novel epidemics emerge – substantially decreasing the time to develop a new vaccine. Public health surveillance expert and professor at Harvard University, John Brownstein says that \"vaccines are still our main weapon\". Besides more rapid vaccine development and development that starts at the earliest possible time, it may also be possible to develop more broader vaccines. Misinformation and misconceptions about vaccines, including about their side-effects and (relative) risks, may be a problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "A review suggests that feeding the future human population would require increases in crop and animal production, albeit it is unclear which diets (e.g. future levels of meat production) they project. This would increase contact rates between humans and both wild and domestic animals and the use of antibiotics and thereby increase pandemic risks. It also suggests that \"since 1940, agricultural drivers were associated with >25% of all — and >50% of zoonotic — infectious diseases that emerged in humans\".\n",
      "\n",
      " Moreover, selection for specific genes has made the animals genetically highly similar which could enable pathogens to spread more intensely among the livestock.\n",
      "A report by the FAIRR global investor network found that more than 70% of the biggest meat, fish and dairy producers were in danger of fostering future zoonotic pandemics due to lax safety standards, closely confined animals and the overuse of antibiotics. Some have recommended food system-change, behaviour change, different lifestyle choices and altered consumer spending including moving away from factory farming and towards more plant-based diets.\n",
      "Measures could include reducing meat production (except for potential cultured meat), de-intensifying livestock farming, reducing the use of antimicrobials, improving health and health-monitoring of livestock, increasing livestock biodiversity, further understanding of the genetic and functional basis of host adaptation, improving occupational hygiene and safety of farming and food processing/food (see also: HACCP and COVID-19 software (including contact tracing)).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Culling ====\n",
      "Experts warned that depleting the numbers of species by culling to forestall human infections reduces genetic diversity and thereby puts future generations of the animals as well as people at risk while others contend that it's still the best, practical way to contain a virus of livestock. There are also other problems with culling and there are alternatives to it, such as animal vaccination. There are also problems with the forms of culling-implementation such as livestock producers and subsistence farmers who are unable to access compensation being motivated to conceal diseased animals rather than report them.\n",

      "\n",
      "== Prevention versus mitigation ==\n",
      "\n",
      "Pandemic prevention seeks to prevent pandemics while mitigation of pandemics seeks to reduce their severity and negative impacts. Some have called for a shift from a treatment-oriented society to a prevention-oriented one. Authors of a 2010 study write that contemporary \"global disease control focuses almost exclusively on responding to pandemics after they have already spread globally\" and argue that the \"wait-and-respond approach is not sufficient and that the development of systems to prevent novel pandemics before they are established should be considered imperative to human health\". Peter Daszak comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, saying \"[t]he problem isn't that prevention was impossible, [i]t was very possible. But we didn't do it. Governments thought it was too expensive. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit\". The WHO reportedly had mostly neither the funding nor the power to enforce the large-scale global collaboration necessary to combat it. Nathan Wolfe criticizes that \"our current global public health strategies are reminiscent of cardiology in the 1950s when doctors focused solely on responding to heart attacks and ignored the whole idea of prevention\". Nevertheless, measures that improve pandemic mitigation capabilities and preparedness for mitigation are important – for example the development of novel far-ultraviolet light could make sterilization \"easy, routine and effective\".\n",

He was also inspired by his fears of nuclear holocaust throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and the anti-nuclear protests in RAF Greenham Common. He felt that \"while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away\", and felt the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety. Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of Howard Hughes approximately during the time of production of Martin Scorsese\\'s The Aviator (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person\\'s life.

Oppenheimer is the first screenplay written by Nolan in the first person, as he wanted the narrative to be conveyed from Oppenheimer\\'s perspective. He described the \"texture\" of the film being \"how the personal interacts with the historic and the geopolitical\" with the intention of making it a cautionary tale.

      "{'title': 'Oppenheimer (film)', 'body': 'A major plot element is Oppenheimer\\'s response to the long-term consequences of his actions. Nolan wished to explore the phenomenon of delayed reactions, as he felt people are not \"necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of [their actions] in the moment\". He also chose to alternate between scenes in color and black-and-white to convey the story from both subjective and objective perspectives, respectively, with most of Oppenheimer\\'s view shown via the former, while the latter depicts a \"more objective view of his story from a different character\\'s point of view\". Wanting to make the film as subjective as possible, the production team decided to include visions of Oppenheimer\\'s conceptions of the quantum world and waves of energy. Nolan noted that while Oppenheimer never publicly apologized for his role in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he still believed Oppenheimer had felt genuine guilt for his actions and thus portrayed him as exhibiting those feelings'}\n",

He also wanted to explore Tatlock\\'s influence on Oppenheimer\\'s life, since she was a Communist, which had \"enormous ramifications for [Oppenheimer\\'s] later life and his ultimate fate\". Nolan also sought to explore the relationship between Oppenheimer and Admiral Lewis Strauss, former chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, having been inspired by the relationship between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri as depicted in Amadeus (1984)'}\n",

He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the \"highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible\". For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to present a \"strong set of troubling reverberations at the end\"'}\n",

To prepare for the role, Murphy read extensively on Oppenheimer's life and was inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s. Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted, excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room. Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance. Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014).

Downey went to Nolan\\'s house to read the script, which was printed in black on red paper. Downey would later describe Oppenheimer as \"the best film\" in which he has appeared to date. Blunt met Nolan in Los Angeles and, when she was offered the role of Katherine \"Kitty\" Oppenheimer, she enthusiastically accepted; she also contacted Murphy to get an expectation of what working with Nolan would be like. Asked to play the part of Leslie Groves, Damon—who had appeared in Nolan\\'s Interstellar—was taking a break from acting as a result of negotiations with his wife in couples therapy, but signed on to Oppenheimer as he had reserved one exception: if Nolan offered him a role in a film. Nolan cast writer-director Benny Safdie as physicist Edward Teller after asking director Paul Thomas Anderson about his experience directing Safdie in Licorice Pizza (2021).

It took three months to build the set, which was used for only six shooting days. The general plan was to shoot only exterior shots on the set at Ghost Ranch, then shoot interior shots on location inside various historic buildings in the real town of Los Alamos. Interior shooting in Los Alamos began on March 8, 2022. Many scenes in the film take place in academic lecture halls; to save time and money, the production team decided against attempting to reconstruct those halls as sets at Ghost Ranch, and shot them inside a historic Women's Army Corps dormitory in Los Alamos. Scenes were also filmed in Oppenheimer's original cabin in Los Alamos, which had been restored. Kai Bird visited the set and was impressed by Murphy's performance.

Nolan later remarked that it was both \"flattering\" and \"scary\" that his fans would think that of him. The production team was able to obtain government permission to film at White Sands Missile Range, but only at highly inconvenient hours, and therefore chose to film the scene elsewhere in the New Mexico desert. The production filmed the Trinity test scenes in Belen, New Mexico, with Murphy climbing a 100-foot steel tower, a replica of the original site used in the Manhattan Project, in rough weather. A special set was built in which gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium were used to create the explosive effect. Although they used miniatures for the practical effect, the special effects supervisor, Scott R. Fisher, referred to them as \"big-atures\", since the special effects team had tried to build the models as physically large as possible. To make the models look closer to their intended real-life size, the team used forced perspective. Visualizations of the interactions between atoms, molecules and energy waves, as well as the depiction of stars, black holes and supernovas, were also achieved through practical methods.

Stimson is portrayed ordering the removal of Kyoto from the list of top atomic bomb targets, allegedly because it was a favored honeymoon destination for him and his wife. However, historian of science and nuclear weapons, Alex Wellerstein, clarifies that this portrayal is a myth. According to Wellerstein, Stimson\\'s diary from his 1926 travels with his wife does not mention Kyoto, and the only brief visit they made there was in 1929, during a single night stay while on a \"fact-finding\" mission related to his role as Governor-General of the Philippines. The film\\'s depiction overlooks that Stimson\\'s objection to targeting Kyoto was primarily strategic rather than personal. He expressed this viewpoint to President Truman on multiple occasions, including at the Potsdam Conference. Stimson wrote in his diary on July 24, 1945, \"He [Truman] again reiterated with the utmost emphasis his own concurring belief on that subject, and he was particularly emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion that if elimination was not done, the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long post-war period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to the Russians.\"\\nAn omission that drew some criticism was the lack of discussion of the impact of nuclear testing on the Indigenous population around the Trinity test site. Kate Gardner in a review of the film for physicsworld writes, \\nThe one glaring omission from the film is in fact 19,000 omissions – the number of people, mostly Indigenous, who lived near the Trinity test site in New Mexico.

      "{'title': 'Theranostics', 'body': \"=== Radiological scope ===\\nContrast agents with therapeutic properties have been under development for several years. One example is the design of contrast agents capable of releasing a chemotherapeutic agent locally at the target site, triggered by a stimulus provided by the operator. This localized approach aims to increase treatment efficacy and minimize side effects. For instance, ultrasound-based contrast media, such as microbubbles, can accumulate in hypervascularized tissues and release the active ingredient in response to ultrasound waves, thus targeting a specific area chosen by the sonographer. Another approach involves linking monoclonal antibodies (capable of targeting different molecular targets) to nanoparticles. This strategy enhances the drug's affinity and specificity towards the target and enables visualization of the treatment area, such as using superparamagnetic iron oxide particles detectable by magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, these particles can be designed to release chemotherapy agents specifically at the site of binding, producing a local synergistic effect with antibody action.

The PF then called for \"FLAPS 30\" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, \"Flaps 30 and descending\". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap surface movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition [...] \\nThe flight crew then carried out the \"Before Landing Checklist\" before starting the left turn onto the base leg. During that time, the power lever angle increased from 41% to 44%. At this point, the Np of both propellers was recorded as Non-Computed Data (NCD) in the FDR and the torque (Tq) of both engines was at 0%.

At 10:57:11, the power levers were advanced first to 62 degrees then to the maximum power position. At 10:57:20, the PM (who was previously the PF) repeated again that there was no power from the engines [...]\\nThe aircraft\\'s propellers had been feathered for about a minute before the crash, causing the engine to produce no thrust and lead the aircraft into a stall; the condition levers, which control the propellers, were discovered from the wreckage set to the feathered position. Seconds preceding the crash, the pilots discussed a total lack of power and even moved the power lever to the extreme but failed to recognize that the condition levers were incorrectly set. That the condition levers and the flap lever are next to each other in an ATR 72, experts speculate that the monitoring pilot (Kamal KC) had inadvertently moved the former in place of the latter, when asked of by the flying pilot.

He was Justiciar of Scotia and held large territories in the north of Scotland. He is perhaps best remembered for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its cathedral. His sobriquet was earned due to his notorious cruelty and rapacity, but there is no proof that it was used during his lifetime. \\n== Power and influence ==\\nKnown in charters as Alexander Senescalli (Latin for Steward), first noted when, on 14 August 1370, he issued letters patent from Ruthven Castle undertaking to grant protection to the Bishop of Moray and all of his lands, men and property in Badenoch. His father, Robert the Steward, had acquired the lands of Badenoch probably from Euphemia, Countess of Moray who had become his second wife. \\nRobert had a petulant relationship with his uncle, King David II of Scotland. In 1368, he and his sons were required by David's parliament to take an oath that they would keep their undisciplined followers in check—later that year, Robert and Alexander were imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle possibly as a result of these oaths having been broken. Following Robert's accession to the throne, Alexander was formally made Lord of Badenoch on 30 March 1371\"}\n",

Alexander further extended his territorial gains in 1371 by leasing the Urquhart lands from his younger half-brother and then obtained possession of the Barony of Strathavon bordering his Badenoch lands. \\nIn October 1372, Alexander was given the Royal Lieutenancy for those lands outwith the Earldom of Moray north and west of Inverness and added lands in Aberdeenshire and north Perthshire. In the same year, he was Royal Justiciar in the Appin of Dull in Perthshire which meant that Alexander held crown authority from north Perthshire to the Pentland Firth\"}\n",

Other lands belonging to his wife – including Lewis, Skye, Dingwall and Kingedward in Aberdeenshire – he held in joint ownership with her. His possession of the Barony of Kingedward, a large part of the former Earldom of Buchan allowed King Robert to give Alexander the title of Earl of Buchan only days after his marriage. Alexander ruled these territories with the help of his own private cateran forces, building up resentment among other land owners and this included Alexander Bur, Bishop of Moray'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Tomb of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan', 'body': \"== Church defiance ==\\nThere was no dominant potentate in Moray during the 12th and 13th centuries and the bishops ruled their territories with a great deal of independence, but this ended when King Robert I of Scotland elevated his nephew Thomas Randolph to the Earldom of Moray sometime between 12 April and 29 October 1312. The Randolph family did not hold the Earldom for long and it reverted to the crown on the death of Thomas's son John, in 1346, and lay vacant for the next 26 years. In 1365, bishop Bur persuaded David II that his lands in Badenoch and Strathspey should be governed as if in regality. To emphasise this, Bur, when he entered into the protection agreement with Alexander in 1370, ensured that the de facto Lord of Badenoch would have no hold on him, nor his lands and people. \\nA few months later in March 1371, on his father's accession to the throne, Alexander was officially made Lord of Badenoch. Robert II's charter gave Alexander the lands of Badenoch seemingly in regality with, presumably, authority over the church lands however, bishop Bur possibly protested at this, as the details of the grant of Badenoch contained in the Register of the Great Seal has no reference to regality. \\nAlexander was therefore to hold the Badenoch lands with no greater authority than John Comyn had a century before. The bishop continued to come under pressure from Alexander either directly or from his caterans possibly acting independently. Boardman explains that both the bishops of Moray and Aberdeen were in dispute with Alexander regarding the strain that his cateran followers were putting on church lands and tenants. \\nBoardman also theorises that it was this occupation of church lands, virtually rendering them worthless in terms of income, that may have been the reason for Bur 'voluntarily' giving up his rights to estates such as Rothiemurchas, on 20 April 1382. Complicating matters was the fact that neither of the bishops could appeal to the 'legitimate secular authority' as that authority was Alexander himself in his positions of Lord of Badenoch and Royal Lieutenant and was the reason why they appealed directly to the King\"}\n",
      "{'title': 'Tomb of Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan', 'body': \"== Increasing pressure ==\\nKing Robert's reputation declined because of his backing Buchan's methods and so in November 1384, John, Earl of Carrick with the backing of the general council, took executive authority from his father with lawlessness in the north being a major issue. The Lordship of Strathnairn had been administered by Buchan with the approval of the King, but now under Carrick's leadership, Sir David Lindsay was able to reassert his right to Strathnairn. \\nIn April 1385, at the council, Buchan's brother David claimed that Buchan was holding Urquhart unlawfully, while Sir James Lindsay of Crawford reinstated his claim to the Lordship of Buchan and finally, the Earl of Moray demanded that some of Buchan's men be prosecuted for the killing of some of his men. Despite these early attacks on his position, Buchan significantly strengthened his territorial position, especially in the Great Glen where he retained Urquhart after his brother's death and then in the autumn of 1386 he gained the lands of Bona at the head of Loch Ness from the Earl of Moray and the adjoining lands in Abriachin from Sir Robert Chisholm. \\nBuchan's increased influence in Scottish affairs was again furthered when sometime before February 1387, he was appointed Justiciar North of the Forth Carrick's guardianship of Scotland had not been a success and certainly failed to rein in Buchan and so late in 1388, King Robert's second son, Robert, Earl of Fife (Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany) became the effective ruler of the Kingdom. \\nWithin days, Fife removed Buchan from the Justiciarship and, it is assumed, the Royal Lieutenancy and the Sheriffdom of Inverness and later installed his own son, Murdoch as Justiciar North of the Forth. Fife was very uncompromising towards Buchan, who had been described as 'useless to the community' at a previous general council meeting. Buchan had long deserted his wife and lived with Mairead inghean Eachainn with whom he had several children, including Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. Marital law was the prerogative of the Church and so on 2 November 1389, Bishop Alexander Bur of Moray and Bishop Alexander Kylquhous of Ross, ordered his return to his wife, Euphemia. Buchan agreed to this but didn't live up to his promise and so Fife encouraged Euphemia of Ross during her divorce proceedings against Buchan and, in 1392, Euphemia was successful in her appeal to the Avignon papal court and his marriage was annulled. Following the annulment, Buchan lost all claim to Euphemia's lands which returned to her and to her son Alexander Leslie, Earl of Ross who contracted to marry Fife's daughter\"}\n",

Fife was retained as Guardian of Scotland probably much against Buchan's hopes as he must have looked at some sort of volte-face on some of Fife's actions, particularly as Buchan reached his zenith of possessions under Carrick. On top of this, Bishop Bur turned to Thomas Dunbar, Sheriff of Inverness and son of the Earl of Moray to provide his protection. The events of May and June 1390 in the Laich of Moray were perhaps the result of a combination of factors that presented themselves to Buchan. Firstly, John Dunbar, Earl of Moray and his fellow northern landowner Sir David Lindsay of Glenesk both absented themselves from Moray to attend a substantial tourney at Richard II of England's court. In addition, Bishop Bur's involvement with Buchan's estrangement with his wife and then Bur's alignment with Moray presented an opportunity for revenge culminating in the destruction of Forres in May and then Elgin with its cathedral in June. His destruction of the church possessions in Elgin was complete—as well as the cathedral, the monastery of the Greyfriars, St Giles parish church and the Hospital of Maison Dieu were all put to flame. Church and state now came together to oppose him—excommunicated by Bur, Buchan had to appear at the Church of the Friars Preacher, in Perth in the presence of his brothers, King Robert III of Scotland and the Earl of Fife, and the council-general to plead for forgiveness—absolution was granted by bishop Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews\"}\n",

Fife's influence waned during the mid-1390s while that of King Robert and his son David, Earl of Carrick increased—the King took back responsibility for Scottish-English relations and had manoeuvred the Red Douglas Earl of Angus into a dominating position in southeastern Scotland at the expense of Fife's ally, the Black Douglas. Although Fife's authority over Scottish affairs had lessened he still exercised considerable power in government. Fife and Carrick both campaigned against Buchan and his sons and other lawless elements in the west and north. Although Buchan appeared to have halted his violent traits after this, his sons did not. A fight ensued near Pitlochry involving Duncan and Robert Stewart at the head of a band of caterans when Sir Walter Ogilvie and Walter de Lychton and followers were killed.

Initially E.U. politicians had shrugged off this development, assuming net revenues for Russia were much lower due to steep discounts and lower prices on the global market, but as India had expanded its capabilities in oil refining and re-exporting particularly diesel fuel to Europe, this development had again been interpreted by Western nations as a problematic breach of international sanctions they impose to curtail Russia’s ambitions during the war in Ukraine.

In September 2019, police seized 16 knives, a dagger, and a sword from Crimo after a family member reported to the police that he planned to \"kill everyone\". Crimo\\'s father said the weapons were his, however, and both parents denied Crimo had threatened anyone.

On either occasion, Highland Park police could have invoked Illinois\\' red flag law, which would have allowed them to seek a restraining order preventing Crimo from buying guns for up to six months. However, they did not pursue this option. Just four months later, in January 2020, Illinois State Police approved Crimo for a firearms permit, and he passed four background checks when buying firearms in 2020 and 2021. When asked why the \"clear and present danger\" report did not prevent Crimo from obtaining a FOID card, Illinois State Police said that Crimo denied that he would harm himself or others when questioned; moreover, \"no one, including family, was willing to move forward on a complaint\" or to provide pertinent information relating to threats or to mental health, any of which could have enabled further action by law enforcement'}\n",

Like other ridesharing companies, the company classifies its drivers as gig workers/independent contractors. This has become the subject of legal action in several jurisdictions. The company has disrupted taxicab businesses and allegedly caused an increase in traffic congestion. Ridesharing companies are regulated in many jurisdictions and the Uber platform is not available in several countries where the company is not able or willing to comply with local regulations. Other controversies involving Uber include various unethical practices such as aggressive lobbying and ignoring and evading local regulations. Many of these were revealed by a leak of documents showing controversial activity between 2013 and 2017 under the leadership of Travis Kalanick'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Controversies involving Uber', 'body': '== Ignoring and evading local regulations ==\\nUber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is \"a technology company\" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber\\'s strategy was generally to \"seek forgiveness rather than permission\". In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber\\'s response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy. \\nMore than 124,000 Uber documents covering the five-year period from 2012 to 2017 when Uber was run by its co-founder Travis Kalanick were leaked by Mark MacGann, a lobbyist who \"led Uber\\'s efforts to win over governments across Europe, the Middle East and Africa\", to The Guardian newspaper and first printed on 10 July 2022 by its Sunday sister The Observer. The documents revealed attempts to lobby Joe Biden, Olaf Scholz and George Osborne; how Emmanuel Macron secretly aided Uber lobbying in France, and use of a kill switch during police raids to conceal data. Travis Kalanick dismissed concerns from other executives that sending Uber drivers to a protest in France put them at risk of violence from angry opponents in the taxi industry, saying \"I think it\\'s worth it, violence guarantees success\"'}\n",

However, Uber agreed a $178 million payout in a similar class action lawsuit in Australia.

The tool identified government officials using geofencing, mining credit card databases, identifying devices, and searches of social media. While at first, Uber stated that it only used the tool to identify riders that violated its terms of service, after investigations by Portland, Oregon, and the United States Department of Justice, Uber admitted to using the tool to skirt local regulations and promised not to use the tool for that purpose.

Kalanick took an indefinite leave of absence but, under pressure from investors, he resigned as CEO a week later. Also departing the company in June 2017 was Emil Michael, a senior vice president who suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to \"dig up dirt\" on the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber, specifically targeting Sarah Lacy, editor of PandoDaily, who, in an article published in October 2014, accused Uber of sexism and misogyny in its advertising. In August 2018, Uber agreed to pay a total of $7 million to settle claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and hostile work environment, with 480 employees and former employees receiving $10,700 each and 56 of those employees and former employees receiving an additional $33,900 each.

They came to be administered only after the Kuki Rebellion of 1917–1919, by British administrators without the involvement of the Meitei state. After Indian independence, the hill tribes continued to enjoy a protected status. Even though the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, prohibits transfer of tribal land to non-tribals except by special permission, the seventh amendment (2015) is seen as an attempt by the valley dwellers to grab tribal land.

He portrayed the Wagner Group\\'s rebellion as his response to the Russian Armed Forces allegedly attacking and killing hundreds of his Wagner mercenaries, which the Russian government denied. Characterizing it as a \"march of justice\" against the Russian military establishment, he demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be removed from their positions, and eventually stated that Russia\\'s justification for attacking Ukraine was a lie.

However, Prigozhin declined to sign the agreement, alleging incompetence on the part of Shoigu. Reports from the independent Russian news outlet Meduza indicated that this development would undermine Prigozhin's hold over Wagner and jeopardize the group's profitable operations in Africa. Prigozhin unsuccessfully attempted to circumvent the order for Wagner's subordination while intensifying his criticism of the MoD.

Western officials said intelligence findings indicated that Prigozhin\\'s plan rested on his belief that a part of the armed forces would join the rebellion, and that they believed Prigozhin had informed some senior military offices about his plan.

Multiple publications have noted that the rebellion has weakened Putin\\'s public image. Andrey Kolesnikov expressed a view that although the rebellion eroded Putin\\'s image, the Russian population did not view Prigozhin\\'s challenge to the establishment as a credible alternative. Therefore, they are assessed likely to continue providing support, whether genuine or feigned, to Putin\\'s administration. According to some analysts, the rebellion laid bare an inherent weakness of Putin\\'s system of power built upon a ruling coalition of competing power centers and a structure of subordinate \"nominal\" institutions that was strained by the descent into a militarised state and society. According to a New York Times analysis, the rebellion undermined Putin\\'s legitimacy which relies on being viewed as a guarantor of stability and security, which may cause a lasting erosion of support among the Russian power elite.

Meanwhile, according to a Guardian analysis, \"The emerging consensus – from experts and in western capitals – is [that the rebellion] was far less than an attempted coup, and more an impulsive demonstration that quickly got out of hand.\" According to The Guardian, air strikes on the column were conducted because no ground defense force was available to counter the convoy and with Moscow\\'s defenses deficient, it was conceivable that the Wagner convoy would have penetrated the hastily erected defensive lines on the Oka River and reached the roadway circle surrounding Moscow and possibly have captured the capital, however, this may have been a futile act as it was becoming increasingly clear that he failed to rally outside support which was essential for his rebellion to succeed.

The secular, modernizing Pahlavi dynasty, founded by Reza Shah in the early twentieth century (1925), had placed the improved treatment of women at the center of its project to modernize Iran. Reza Shah banned the wearing of hijab in public and admitted women to universities. During the reign of his successor and son Mohammad Reza Shah, restrictions on the wearing of hijab were lifted but women were granted suffrage, allowed to enter parliament, and \"gained dramatically more rights in marriage\"'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Mahsa Amini protests', 'body': \"The Revolution rescinded the legal rights the Pahlavi Shahs granted women, removed restrictions on men's rights to polygamy and child marriage, and reversed Reza Shah's ban on hijab to make the complete covering of women's hair in public compulsory. Enforcement of the unpopular law was eased during the 2013–2021 tenure of moderate President Rouhani, but intensified under Rouhani's successor, the hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi\"}\n",

Enrollment of women in universities jumped from 3% in 1977 to 67% in 2015, according to the World Bank statistics. But many of the women who left home to study and developed new values and world views, struggled to secure jobs that matched their new competencies, and became less content with the Islamic Republic than their parents\"}\n",

According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, economic hardship and poor living conditions contributed to the growth of the protests. The New York Times itemized Iranian grievances such as \"soaring prices, high unemployment, corruption, (and) political repression\", and identified the poor Iranian economy as a major driving force behind the protests. According to an Iranian report in August 2021, a third of Iranians live in poverty. Abdolreza Davari, a conservative analyst, quoted a statistic that 95 percent of Iranians are \"worried about their livelihoods today and for their and their children\\'s future.\" Only 15% of Iranians in the job market are women.

Some demonstrators packed extra clothes to replace painted clothes, wore masks to avoid identification, and dismantled public security cameras. Some protesters chanted from windows or rooftops. Symbolic protests include dyeing fountains blood-red, and women discarding and burning their hijabs or cutting their hair in public. Since turbans are viewed as a symbol of the regime, some Iranians engaged in turban throwing (knocking the turbans off of \"privileged\" Iranian clerics on the street and running away).

For many years scientists debated on whether Venus was currently active or if the volcanic structures were remnants from the past. There are few impact craters on Venus' surface which pointed to relatively recent resurfacing. The most likely resurfacing event would have been volcanic flows. Radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank. Although many lines of evidence such as this suggest that volcanoes on Venus have been recently active, present-day eruptions at Maat Mons have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, other more recent studies, in 2020, suggest that Venus, though not Maat Mons specifically, is indeed currently volcanically active. In 2023, scientists reexamined topographical images of the Maat Mons region taken by the Magellan orbiter. Using computer simulations they determined that the topography had changed during an 8-month interval, and have concluded that active volcanism was the cause. Until 2023, there had only been hints of active volcanism.

The shield volcanoes, for example those in Hawaii, eject magma from the depths of the Earth in zones called hot spots. The lava from these volcanoes is relatively fluid and permits the escape of gases. Composite volcanoes, such as Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates. In this type of volcano, the oceanic crust of one plate is sliding underneath the other in a subduction zone, together with an inflow of seawater, producing a gummier lava that restricts the exit of the gases, and for that reason, composite volcanoes tend to erupt more violently'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Volcanism on Venus', 'body': 'On Venus, where there are no tectonic plates or seawater, volcanoes are mostly of the shield type. Nevertheless, the morphology of volcanoes on Venus is different: on Earth, shield volcanoes can be a few tens of kilometres wide and up to 10 km (6.2 mi) high in the case of Mauna Kea, measured from the sea floor. On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometres in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of 1.5 km (0.93 mi). Large volcanoes cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward because of their enormous vertical loads, producing flexural moats or ring fractures around the edifices. Large volcano edifice loading also causes magma chambers to fracture in a sill-like pattern, affecting magma propagation beneath the surface'}\n",

Recent radar imagery shows more than 1,000 volcanic structures and evidence of possible periodic resurfacing of the planet by floods of lava. In addition to the radar images, there is supporting evidence that volcanism has taken place, including an unusual change in the amount of sulphur dioxide gas in the upper atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide is an important component of volcanic outgassing. However, the sulphur dioxide in the lower atmosphere remains stable. This could mean that a change in the global atmosphere caused the sulphur dioxide concentration to increase above the clouds. Even though the change in the atmosphere may be evidence that there have been volcanoes that erupted in Venus, it is difficult to determine whether they occurred or not. In 2014, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was located, in the form of infrared \"flashes\" over the edges of rift zone Ganis Chasma, near the shield volcano Sapas Mons. These flashes were detectable during two or three consecutive Earth days in 2008 and 2009 and are thought to be caused either by hot gases or lava released from volcanic eruptions.

The phosphines were detected at a height of 70 km, which implies a volcanic eruption on the explosive scale of Krakatau or Yellowstone on Earth.

The most important transmission pathways often vary per underlying driver of emerging infectious diseases such as the vector-borne pathway and direct animal contact for land-use change – the leading driver for emerging zoonoses by number of emergence events as defined by Jones et al. (2008). 75% of the reviewed 1415 species of infectious organisms known to be pathogenic to humans account for zoonoses by 2001. Genomics could be used to precisely monitor virus evolution and transmission in real time across large, diverse populations by combining pathogen genomics with data about host genetics and about the unique transcriptional signature of infection. The \"Surveillance, Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System\" (SORMAS) of the German Helmholtz-Zentrum für Infektionsforschung (HZI) and Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung (DZIF), who collaborate with Nigerian researchers, gathers and analyzes data during an outbreak, detects potential threats and allows to initiate protective measures early.

The scientific and technological ways of quickly detecting a spillover could be improved so that an outbreak can be isolated before it becomes an epidemic or pandemic. David Quammen states that he heard about the idea to develop technology to screen people at airport security points for whether or not they carry an infectious disease ten years ago and thought it was going to be done by now. Thermometers whose measurement data is directly shared via the Internet and medical guidance apps have been used to plot and map unusual fever levels to detect anomalous outbreaks. Various forms of data-sharing could be added to health care institutions such as hospitals so that e.g. anonymized data about symptoms and incidences found to be unusual or characteristic of a pandemic threat could enable high-resolution \"syndromic surveillance\" as an early warning system. In 1947, the World Health Organization established such a global network of some hospitals. Such sharing and off-site evaluation of symptoms and possibly related medical data may have complementary benefits such as improving livelihoods of workers who work with livestock and improving the accuracy, timeliness and costs of disease prognoses. The WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence is an early-warning center that attempts to aggregate data and quickly analyze it to predict, prevent, detect, prepare for, and respond to outbreaks and was set up Berlin in September 2021. It uses machine learning and may analyze data about animal health, unusual symptoms in humans, migration and other related developments that may contain detectable patterns'}\n",

While mutations are common for viruses and the spread of some of the virus' mutations have been tracked earlier, mutations that make it more transmittable or severe can be problematic. Resources for disease surveillance have improved during the pandemic so that medical systems around the world are starting to be equipped to detect such mutations with genomic surveillance in a manner relevant to pandemic mitigation and the prevention of sub-pandemics of specific variants or types of variants. As of December 2020, contemporary measures such as COVID-19 vaccines and medications seem to be effective in the treatment of infections with the tracked mutated variants compared to earlier forms that are closer to the original virus/es.

A global treaty proposed by the E.U. includes such incentives. A further issue was that vaccines did not provide a high enduring protection against the variants.

      "{'title': 'Pandemic prevention', 'body': '===== Ecosystem degradation and consumption =====\\nStudies have shown that the risk of disease outbreaks can increase substantially after forests are cleared. The likelihood of human-nonhuman primates contact events is increased jointly by forest landscape fragmentation and certain smallholders\\' behaviors in forest patches. A study identified the mechanistic connections among habitat loss, climate, and increased bat virus spillover risk. Loss of biodiversity may remove natural regulation of viruses and make fleeing animals meet other species for the first time. According to Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at University College London, the disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, resulting in transmission of diseases from wildlife to humans. An August 2020 study published in Nature concludes that the anthropogenic destruction of ecosystems for the purpose of expanding agriculture and human settlements reduces biodiversity and allows for smaller animals such as bats and rats, who are more adaptable to human pressures and also carry the most zoonotic diseases, to proliferate. This in turn can result in more pandemics. In October 2020, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published its report on the \\'era of pandemics\\' by 22 experts in a variety of fields, and concluded that anthropogenic destruction of biodiversity is paving the way to the pandemic era, and could result in as many as 850,000 viruses being transmitted from animals – in particular birds and mammals – to humans. The increased pressure on ecosystems is being driven by the \"exponential rise\" in consumption and trade of commodities such as meat, palm oil, and metals, largely facilitated by developed nations, and by a growing human population. According to Peter Daszak, the chair of the group who produced the report, \"there is no great mystery about the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, or of any modern pandemic. The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment.\"\\nStanford biological anthropologist James Holland Jones notes that humanity has \"engineer[ed] a world where emerging infectious diseases are both more likely and more likely to be consequential\", referring to the modern world\\'s prevalent highly mobile lifestyles, increasingly dense cities, various kinds of human interactions with wildlife and alterations of the natural world. Furthermore, when multiple species that are not usually next to each other are driven to live closely together new diseases may emerge. Research shows that abundant animals, plants, insects, and microbes living in complex, mature ecosystems can limit the spread of disease from animals to people. The United Nations is formulating nature-focused action plans that could help to stop the next pandemic before it starts. These strategies include conserving ecosystems and wilderness that are still untouched by human activity, and restoring and protecting significant areas of land and ocean (i.e. through protected areas). Protected areas (which may hold wildlife) also limits human presence and/or limits the exploitation of resources (including non-timber forest products such as game animals, fur-bearers, ...). An article by the World Economic Forum states that studies have shown that deforestation and loss of wildlife cause increases in infectious diseases and concludes that the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic should be linked to nature recovery, which it considers economically beneficial'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer', 'body': \"The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice, formerly JUICE) is an interplanetary spacecraft on its way to orbit and study three icy moons of Jupiter: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. These planetary-mass moons are planned to be studied because they are thought to have beneath their frozen surfaces significant bodies of liquid water, which would make them potentially habitable for extraterrestrial life. \\nJUICE is the first interplanetary spacecraft to the outer Solar System planets not launched by the United States and the first set to orbit a moon other than Earth's Moon. Launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), from Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana on 14 April 2023, with Airbus Defence and Space as the main contractor, it is expected to reach Jupiter in July 2031 after four gravity assists and eight years of travel. In December 2034, the spacecraft will enter orbit around Ganymede for its close-up science mission. Its period of operations will overlap with NASA's Europa Clipper mission, launching in 2024\"}\n",

The orbit insertions at Jupiter and Ganymede and the large number of flyby manoeuvres (more than 25 gravity assists, and two Europa flybys) require the spacecraft to carry about 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of chemical propellant. The total delta-V capability of the spacecraft is about 2,700 m/s (6,000 mph). \\nJuice has a fixed 2.5 meter diameter high-gain antenna and a steerable medium-gain antenna, both X- and K-band will be used.

He also forecasted relatively high prices at around $80-85 (roughly €72-77) per barrel to continue well into 2024.

Initially E.U. politicians had shrugged off this development, assuming net revenues for Russia were much lower due to steep discounts and lower prices on the global market, but as India had expanded its capabilities in oil refining and re-exporting particularly diesel fuel to Europe, this development had again been interpreted by Western nations as a problematic breach of international sanctions they impose to curtail Russia’s ambitions during the war in Ukraine.

      "Oppenheimer is a 2023 epic biographical thriller drama film written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. It follows the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helped develop the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles Oppenheimer's studies, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory and his 1954 security hearing. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer, alongside Robert Downey Jr. as the United States Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss.

      "Oliver Stone deemed the film \"a classic, which I never believed could be made in this climate\". Paul Schrader called Oppenheimer, \"the best, most important film of this century\", while Denis Villeneuve called it \"a masterpiece\". Steven Soderbergh said of the film, \"Oppenheimer is a real accomplishment. I read somewhere that Chris [Nolan] implied that this is the movie he's been building toward, and I think he's right. And I'm thrilled that it's a massive hit.\" Spike Lee also praised the film, calling it a 'great film', but felt that it should have showed what happened to the Japanese people, given the film's length. Japanese director Takashi Yamazaki said, “As a person of Japanese ancestry and descent, my response to Oppenheimer [is that] I would like to dedicate a different film to that when that day comes.”\n",
      "==== Accuracy and omissions ====\n",
      "The film was noted for its accuracy, with some scenes being taken word-for-word out of the book or real life events. Many of the changes are small embellishments or changes from real life. For example, Oppenheimer was not as excited about his discovery of black holes as shown in the film since he did not know how significant it would become. The study was indeed released on the same day Germany invaded Poland, as shown in the film. During the Trinity test, Donald Hornig had his hand on the kill switch for a faster reaction time and not near it as depicted in the film. Truman did call Oppenheimer a \"crybaby\" but in a letter to Dean Acheson one year later, not immediately after meeting Oppenheimer\n",

      "Oppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead. To prepare for the role, Murphy read extensively on Oppenheimer's life and was inspired by David Bowie's appearance in the 1970s. Nolan called Murphy one day to ask him to play the part, and Murphy enthusiastically accepted, excited to play a lead role in a Nolan film. Afterward, Nolan flew to Dublin to meet with Murphy, who read the script in Nolan's hotel room. Murphy lost an undisclosed amount of weight for the role in order to better match the real-life Oppenheimer's gaunt appearance. Nolan also set up a phone call between Murphy and Nobel laureate Kip Thorne, who had previously worked with Nolan on Interstellar (2014). As a graduate student, Thorne had attended some of Oppenheimer's seminars, and explained to Murphy his experience with Oppenheimer's gift for facilitating group discussions of difficult scientific concepts\n",
      "0.25310689210891724\n",
      "Nolan had long desired to make a film about Oppenheimer, even prior to reading American Prometheus. In 2019, towards the end of production on Nolan's science-fiction film Tenet (2020), star Robert Pattinson gave him a book of Oppenheimer's speeches. According to Nolan, the speeches showed Oppenheimer \"wrestling with the implications ... of what's happened and what [he's] done\". Nolan wanted to depict \"what it would have been like to be Oppenheimer in those moments\", in contrast to Tenet, which employs time travel to curb a potential weapon of mass destruction\n",

In other words, theranostics combines radionuclide imaging and radiation therapy which targets specific biological pathways.\n",
      "Answer: Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is an emerging field in precision medicine that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide the potential for personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments. It utilizes improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies to achieve this goal. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in theranostics by enabling non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. By coupling medical imaging with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics offers opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself. This integration of diagnostics and therapeutics allows for a more personalized and effective approach to treatment.\n",

      " The human climate niche refers to the range of climate conditions that have supported human life and activities throughout history. It is estimated by analyzing human population density in relation to mean annual temperature. The distribution of human population shows two modes, one at 15°C and another between 20-25°C. Crops and livestock essential for sustaining the human population are also limited to similar climate conditions. However, with rising global temperatures, projections indicate that a significant portion of the human population may experience climate conditions outside the human climate niche in the coming decades.\n",
      "Answer: The human climate niche refers to the range of climate conditions that have supported human life and activities, such as agriculture, over the past thousand years. It is estimated by calculating the human population density in relation to the mean annual temperature. The distribution of the human population based on mean annual temperature shows two modes, one at 15 °C and another at approximately 20 to 25 °C. These temperature ranges are also suitable for growing crops and raising livestock, which are essential for sustaining the human population. However, with the increase in global temperatures, it is projected that the human population will experience climate conditions that fall outside of the human climate niche. Projections indicate that by 2030 and 2090, 2.0 and 3.7 billion people, respectively, will be living in areas that are beyond the human climate niche. This highlights the potential challenges and impacts of climate change on human populations.\n",
      "The human climate niche is the ensemble of climate conditions that have sustained human life and human activities, like agriculture, on the globe for the last millennia. The human climate niche is estimated by calculating the human population density with respect to mean annual temperature.

      "Studies have shown that the risk of disease outbreaks can increase substantially after forests are cleared. The likelihood of human-nonhuman primates contact events is increased jointly by forest landscape fragmentation and certain smallholders' behaviors in forest patches. A study identified the mechanistic connections among habitat loss, climate, and increased bat virus spillover risk. Loss of biodiversity may remove natural regulation of viruses and make fleeing animals meet other species for the first time. According to Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at University College London, the disruption of pristine forests driven by logging, mining, road building through remote places, rapid urbanisation and population growth is bringing people into closer contact with animal species they may never have been near before, resulting in transmission of diseases from wildlife to humans. An August 2020 study published in Nature concludes that the anthropogenic destruction of ecosystems for the purpose of expanding agriculture and human settlements reduces biodiversity and allows for smaller animals such as bats and rats, who are more adaptable to human pressures and also carry the most zoonotic diseases, to proliferate. This in turn can result in more pandemics. In October 2020, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services published its report on the 'era of pandemics' by 22 experts in a variety of fields, and concluded that anthropogenic destruction of biodiversity is paving the way to the pandemic era, and could result in as many as 850,000 viruses being transmitted from animals – in particular birds and mammals – to humans. The increased pressure on ecosystems is being driven by the \"exponential rise\" in consumption and trade of commodities such as meat, palm oil, and metals, largely facilitated by developed nations, and by a growing human population. According to Peter Daszak, the chair of the group who produced the report, \"there is no great mystery about the cause of the Covid-19 pandemic, or of any modern pandemic. The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment.\"\n",
      "Stanford biological anthropologist James Holland Jones notes that humanity has \"engineer[ed] a world where emerging infectious diseases are both more likely and more likely to be consequential\", referring to the modern world's prevalent highly mobile lifestyles, increasingly dense cities, various kinds of human interactions with wildlife and alterations of the natural world. Furthermore, when multiple species that are not usually next to each other are driven to live closely together new diseases may emerge. Research shows that abundant animals, plants, insects, and microbes living in complex, mature ecosystems can limit the spread of disease from animals to people. The United Nations is formulating nature-focused action plans that could help to stop the next pandemic before it starts. These strategies include conserving ecosystems and wilderness that are still untouched by human activity, and restoring and protecting significant areas of land and ocean (i.e. through protected areas). Protected areas (which may hold wildlife) also limits human presence and/or limits the exploitation of resources (including non-timber forest products such as game animals, fur-bearers, ...). An article by the World Economic Forum states that studies have shown that deforestation and loss of wildlife cause increases in infectious diseases and concludes that the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic should be linked to nature recovery, which it considers economically beneficial\n",

The condition levers, which control the propellers, were discovered from the wreckage set to the feathered position. The pilots discussed a total lack of power and even moved the power lever to the extreme but failed to recognize that the condition levers were incorrectly set.\n",
      "Answer: The crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal was caused by a technical issue with the plane. According to a spokesperson from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the weather was clear at the time of the crash, and preliminary information suggests that the crash was due to a technical problem. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders were recovered and examined, and a preliminary report indicated that the propellers of the aircraft had been feathered, causing the engines to produce no thrust and leading the plane into a stall. It was also noted that the power levers and condition levers were incorrectly set, possibly due to a mistake during the landing checklist.

The PF then called for \"FLAPS 30\" at 10:56:32, and the PM replied, \"Flaps 30 and descending\". The flight data recorder (FDR) data did not record any flap surface movement at that time. Instead, the propeller rotation speed (Np) of both engines decreased simultaneously to less than 25% and the torque (Tq) started decreasing to 0%, which is consistent with both propellers going into the feathered condition [...] \n",

That the condition levers and the flap lever are next to each other in an ATR 72, experts speculate that the monitoring pilot (Kamal KC) had inadvertently moved the former in place of the latter, when asked of by the flying pilot.

      "Theranostics has been applied in oncology, contributing to new approaches in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of cancers. By integrating diagnostic imaging and targeted therapies, theranostics offers personalized approaches that improve treatment outcomes and patient care. In oncology, theranostics encompasses a wide range of applications, including the management of various types of cancers such as breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Molecular imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), enable the visualization and characterization of cancerous lesions, aiding in early detection, staging, and assessment of treatment response. This allows for more accurate and tailored treatment planning, including the selection of appropriate targeted therapies or the optimization of radiation therapy. Despite the significant progress, the translation of theranostics into routine clinical practice faces challenges, including the need for standardized imaging protocols, biomarker validation, and regulatory considerations. Additionally, there is a continuous need for research and development to further enhance the effectiveness and accessibility of theranostic approaches in oncology\n",

The species is near cryptic with the Iberian pantaloon bee Dasypoda morotei, which means that the morphology is both species is highly similar and hardly allows their differentiation. Although tiny morphological features allow to distinguish the females of both species, males remain unidentifiable based on visual examination only. The discovery of Dasypoda radchenkoi as a separate species was initially fortuitous via the genetic barcoding of two specimens, one being the holotype female and the other being a paratype male. The species is only known from the limestone mountains of southern Spain, from where it is thought to be endemic.

Tensions erupted into the war in Donbas in early May, and during the unrest, militiamen of the separatist and Russian-backed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) took control of the city and forced Ukrainian troops to abandon it during the first battle for Mariupol. However, the following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the city in an offensive. In August, the DPR and Russian troops captured the village of Novoazovsk, 45 km east of Mariupol near the Russo-Ukrainian border. With the town captured and forces renewed, in September the DPR attempted to capture the city again in the second battle for Mariupol. Fighting reached the eastern outskirts, but the separatists were eventually repelled. In October, then-DPR Prime Minister Alexander Zakharchenko vowed to retake the city. Mariupol was then indiscriminately bombed by rockets in January 2015. Fearing a future third offensive into Mariupol, in February Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack into Shyrokyne, a village located 11 km east of Mariupol with the objective of expelling the separatist forces from the city limits and creating a buffer zone.

      "Question: What factors contributed to the Sri Lankan economic crisis?\n",
      " The Sri Lankan economic crisis is a result of multiple compounding factors, including tax cuts, money creation, a nationwide policy to shift to organic or biological farming, the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. Additionally, the quantitative easing policy made by US banks after 2008 is also considered to have contributed to the crisis, as it led to low global interest rates and facilitated Sri Lanka's borrowing-and-spending spree. The winding-down of quantitative easing in the US after 2013 sharply increased Sri Lanka's borrowing costs, further exacerbating the crisis.\n",
      "Answer: The Sri Lankan economic crisis was caused by multiple compounding factors. These include tax cuts and money creation by the government, which led to budget deficits and a decline in government revenue. The government's decision to shift to organic or biological farming also played a role. Additionally, the crisis was exacerbated by the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's high external debt, with a significant increase in foreign debt in recent years, also contributed to the crisis. The combination of these factors resulted in unprecedented levels of inflation, near-depletion of foreign exchange reserves, shortages of medical supplies, and an increase in prices of basic commodities.\n",
      "The Sri Lankan economic crisis is an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka that started in 2019. It is the country's worst economic crisis since its independence in 1948. It has led to unprecedented levels of inflation, near-depletion of foreign exchange reserves, shortages of medical supplies, and an increase in prices of basic commodities. The crisis is said to have begun due to multiple compounding factors like tax cuts, money creation, a nationwide policy to shift to organic or biological farming, the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sri Lanka. The subsequent economic hardships resulted in the 2022 Sri Lankan protests. Sri Lanka received a lifeline in the form of an Indian line of credit amounting to $4 billion. This substantial credit infusion served to cover the costs of importing essential goods and fuel. As a result, the foreign currency reserves of debt-ridden Sri Lanka experienced a notable improvement, reaching $2.69 billion\n",
      "0.22134172916412354\n",
      "In 2020, US economist Joseph Eugene Stiglitz, published a report that blamed the quantitative easing policy made by US banks after 2008, for exporting debt bubbles to developing countries including Sri Lanka. In the same year, Chatham House published a report that concluded that Sri Lanka's debt crisis was primarily \"a result of domestic policy decisions and was facilitated by Western lending and monetary policy\". Their research pointed that after 2008, western central banks had favored a monetary policy of quantitative easing, which created low global interest rates, and had largely facilitated Rajapaksa's borrowing-and-spending spree as he borrowed low interest ISBs heavily. However the winding-down of quantitative easing in the US after 2013, had later sharply increased Sri Lanka's borrowing costs, and the interests rates doubled, to approximately 10 percent for short-term loans, while long-term rates had jumped from 7 to 8 percent to 11–13 percent.

The company has also faced criticism for its treatment of employees, with allegations of racial discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace. Concerns have also been raised about Uber's retention of customer data and its handling of data breaches. These controversies have led to Uber being banned from operating in some countries.\n",

This has become the subject of legal action in several jurisdictions. The company has disrupted taxicab businesses and allegedly caused an increase in traffic congestion. Ridesharing companies are regulated in many jurisdictions and the Uber platform is not available in several countries where the company is not able or willing to comply with local regulations.

      "Uber has been criticized for its strategy of generally commencing operations in a city without regard for local regulations. If faced with regulatory opposition, Uber called for public support for its service and mounted a political campaign, supported by lobbying, to change regulations. Uber argued that it is \"a technology company\" and not a taxi company, and therefore it was not subject to regulations affecting taxi companies. Uber's strategy was generally to \"seek forgiveness rather than permission\". In 2014, with regards to airport pickups without a permit in California, drivers were actually told to ignore local regulations and that the company would pay for any citations. Uber's response to California Assembly Bill 5 (2019), whereby it announced that it would not comply with the law, then engaged lobbyists and mounted an expensive public opinion campaign to overturn it via a ballot, was cited as an example of this policy. \n",

The documents revealed attempts to lobby Joe Biden, Olaf Scholz and George Osborne; how Emmanuel Macron secretly aided Uber lobbying in France, and use of a kill switch during police raids to conceal data.

      " The ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023 was primarily caused by a row over an affirmative action measure. The Manipur High Court's order to send a recommendation to the central government on the demand for a Scheduled Tribe status by the valley-based Meitei community sparked protests from the Kuki-Zo tribal community. Clashes broke out between the two groups, leading to widespread violence.\n",

Additionally, 4,786 houses were burnt and 386 religious structures were vandalized. The violence also led to heightened tensions between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, with the latter demanding a separate body to administer their community under the constitution of India.\n",
      "Answer: The ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023 was sparked by tensions between the Meitei people, who reside in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki tribal community from the surrounding hills. The violence erupted after a High Court ordered that the Meitei community be recommended for Scheduled Tribe status, which caused protests and clashes between the two groups. The violence resulted in the deaths of 142 people, with over 300 wounded and approximately 54,488 people displaced. Houses, places of worship, and other properties were burnt and destroyed during the riots. The violence also deepened existing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities, with inflammatory statements made by political leaders further exacerbating the situation. A panel led by a retired Chief Justice was established to investigate the violence, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe six cases related to conspiracy in the violence.\n",

      "Answer: The Chinese balloon that was spotted in North American airspace was approximately 200 feet (61 meters) tall and had a diameter of 148 feet (45 meters). The payload of the balloon was estimated to weigh more than 2,000 pounds (910 kilograms). The balloon was a superpressure balloon, similar to earlier NASA designs, which allowed for better altitude control and longer endurance compared to other balloon designs.

On February 4, the U.S. Air Force shot down the balloon over U.S. territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina. Debris from the wreckage was recovered and sent to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis. Following a preliminary analysis of the debris in June, U.S. officials stated that the balloon carried intelligence-gathering equipment but does not appear to have sent information back to China. U.S. president Joe Biden described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment, however stated that it was \"not a major breach\", and that he also believed that the Chinese leadership was not aware of the balloon.

Other officials reported that the balloon loitered near sensitive military sites and made multiple passes under control. Experts interviewed by Time said that the balloon traveled much farther than a typical weather balloon would and Chinese officials should not be surprised that it would eventually reach the contiguous United States or be detected. The balloon flew at an altitude of 60,000 feet (18,000 m). In comparison, business jets can reach 51,000 feet (16,000 m), commercial airliners can reach 45,000 feet (14,000 m), and the SR-71 (an American surveillance plane) had reached 90,000 feet (27,000 m)\n",

      " The Wagner Group's rebellion in 2023 was sparked by the ongoing conflict between the Wagner Group and the Russian Ministry of Defense. The rebellion began on June 23, 2023, when the Wagner Group, a private military company, staged an uprising against the Russian government. The cause of the rebellion was the Wagner Group's dissatisfaction with the Russian government's handling of the war in Ukraine. The rebellion ended on June 25, 2023, when Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin reached an agreement with the Russian government to halt the rebellion.\n",
      "Answer: The rebellion staged by the Wagner Group in 2023 was caused by increasing tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defence and the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin, who was supportive of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, publicly criticized Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, blaming them for the country's military shortcomings. He accused them of handing over \"Russian territories\" to Ukraine. Prigozhin portrayed the rebellion as a response to an alleged attack on his forces by the ministry and demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be turned over to him. Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced Wagner's actions as treason and pledged to quell the rebellion. The rebellion ended when Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko brokered a settlement with Prigozhin, who agreed to end the rebellion. The Federal Security Service closed the case on armed rebellion, dropping the charges.\n",
      "On 23 June 2023, the Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, engaged in a major uprising against the Government of Russia. It marked the climax of the Wagner Group–Ministry of Defense conflict, which had begun about six months earlier. Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who had been leading Wagner Group activities in Ukraine, stood down after reaching an agreement a day later\n",

The PDF, with the strong ground support from local communities, attacked soft government targets like police stations, outposts and junta-owned businesses.

However, the protests quickly evolved into a larger movement calling for wider freedoms, women's rights, and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic. The protests were described as the biggest challenge to the government of Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.\n",
      "Civil unrest and protests against the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran associated with the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini (Persian: مهسا امینی) began on 16 September 2022 and carried on into 2023, but were said to have \"dwindled\" or \"died down\" by spring of 2023.  As of September 2023, the \"ruling elite\" of Iran was said to remain \"deeply entrenched\" in power. The protests were described as \"unlike any the country had seen before\", the \"biggest challenge\" to the government, and \"most widespread revolt\", since the Islamic Revolution in 1979\n",

According to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, economic hardship and poor living conditions contributed to the growth of the protests. The New York Times itemized Iranian grievances such as \"soaring prices, high unemployment, corruption, (and) political repression\", and identified the poor Iranian economy as a major driving force behind the protests. According to an Iranian report in August 2021, a third of Iranians live in poverty. Abdolreza Davari, a conservative analyst, quoted a statistic that 95 percent of Iranians are \"worried about their livelihoods today and for their and their children's future.\" Only 15% of Iranians in the job market are women. Iran ranked 143rd out of 146 countries in the 2022 WEF Gender Gap Report, due in part to prohibitions on female membership in powerful government organizations\n",

      "Question: What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?\n",
      " Venus has several types of volcanoes, including shield volcanoes, pancake domes, and \"tick-like\" structures. Shield volcanoes on Venus are much larger than those on Earth, covering hundreds of kilometers in area but with an average height of only 1.5 kilometers. Pancake domes are unique to Venus and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under the planet's high atmospheric pressure. They can be up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. \"Tick-like\" structures are another type of volcano found on Venus and are characterized by their small size and steep slopes.\n",
      "Answer: On Venus, there are shield volcanoes, pancake dome volcanoes, and scalloped margin domes. Shield volcanoes on Venus can cover hundreds of kilometers in area and have an average height of 1.5 kilometers. They cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward and can produce flexural moats and ring fractures. Pancake dome volcanoes on Venus are up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. They are associated with coronae and tesserae and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Scalloped margin domes, also known as \"tick-like\" structures, have numerous legs and have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. These types of volcanoes are not present on Earth. On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, eject relatively fluid magma from hot spots, while composite volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates and erupt gummier lava.\n",

On Venus, these volcanoes can cover hundreds of kilometres in area, but they are relatively flat, with an average height of 1.5 km (0.93 mi). Large volcanoes cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward because of their enormous vertical loads, producing flexural moats or ring fractures around the edifices. Large volcano edifice loading also causes magma chambers to fracture in a sill-like pattern, affecting magma propagation beneath the surface\n",

There are more than 1,000 volcanic structures and possible periodic resurfacing of Venus by floods of lava. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface.

      "Pandemic prevention seeks to prevent pandemics while mitigation of pandemics seeks to reduce their severity and negative impacts. Some have called for a shift from a treatment-oriented society to a prevention-oriented one. Authors of a 2010 study write that contemporary \"global disease control focuses almost exclusively on responding to pandemics after they have already spread globally\" and argue that the \"wait-and-respond approach is not sufficient and that the development of systems to prevent novel pandemics before they are established should be considered imperative to human health\". Peter Daszak comments on the COVID-19 pandemic, saying \"[t]he problem isn't that prevention was impossible, [i]t was very possible. But we didn't do it. Governments thought it was too expensive. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit\". The WHO reportedly had mostly neither the funding nor the power to enforce the large-scale global collaboration necessary to combat it. Nathan Wolfe criticizes that \"our current global public health strategies are reminiscent of cardiology in the 1950s when doctors focused solely on responding to heart attacks and ignored the whole idea of prevention\". Nevertheless, measures that improve pandemic mitigation capabilities and preparedness for mitigation are important – for example the development of novel far-ultraviolet light could make sterilization \"easy, routine and effective\"\n",

      "The film was released on the same day as Barbie, a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig based on Mattel's Barbie fashion dolls and media franchise, and distributed by Warner Bros. Many speculated that the decision by Warner Bros. to release Barbie on the same day as Oppenheimer was made in order to deplete ticket sales of Oppenheimer as retaliation for Nolan releasing the film with Universal. Due to the tonal and genre dissonance between the two films, many social media users created memes about how the two films appealed to different audiences, and how they should be viewed as a double feature. The trend was dubbed \"Barbenheimer\", and was described as counterprogramming during a summer of \"entertainment industry meltdown\". Cillian Murphy had endorsed the phenomenon, saying \"My advice would be for people to go see both, on the same day. If they are good films, then that's cinema's gain.\"\n",
      "In March 2022, Universal Pictures halted the release of its titles in Russia, joining other major American film distributors in the boycott against the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Oppenheimer had also been banned by Russia's Ministry of Culture, which had refused to license screenings of the film, stating that it did not meet their goals of \"preserving and strengthening traditional Russian spiritual values\"\n",

NFAT proteins share two conserved domains, the NFAT-homology region (NHR) and a DNA-binding domain (DBD). The N- and C-termini display two transactivation domains (TAD-N and TAD-C) that have low sequence similarity. Due to the high sequence conservation in the NHR and DBD, NFAT members have some overlapping roles in gene regulation. However, several studies have shown distinct roles for NFAT proteins in the regulation of cell death. The TAD-C shows low sequence similarity among NFAT family members, but its contribution to specific NFAT1-induced phenotypes is poorly understood. Here, we described at least two regions of NFAT1 TAD-C that confer pro-apoptotic activity to NFAT1. These regions extend from amino acids 699 to 734 and 819 to 850 of NFAT1. We also showed that the NFAT1 TAD-C is unable to induce apoptosis by itself and requires a functional DBD. Furthermore, we showed that when fused to NFAT1 TAD-C, NFAT2, which is associated with cell transformation, induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Together, these results suggest that the NFAT1 TAD-C includes NFAT death domains that confer to different NFAT members the ability to induce apoptosis\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The proteins belonging to the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) family of transcription factors were first reported to play a central role in transcription during immune responses. However, after the isolation and characterization of each protein of the NFAT family, it became clear that their expression was not restricted to T cells. At least one member of the NFAT family is expressed by almost every cell type that has been examined, including immune and non-immune cells [1]. The NFAT family consists of four calcium-responsive proteins named NFAT1 (NFATc2/NFATp), NFAT2 (NFATc1/NFATc), NFAT3 (NFATc4) and NFAT4 (NFATc3/NFATx). The regulation of NFAT by calcium influx is mediated by the NFAT homology region (NHR) [2]. This region is highly phosphorylated in resting cells, maintaining NFAT in an inactivated state in the cytoplasm [2]. Through sustained increases of intracellular calcium, NFAT is activated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation and translocates to the nucleus. NFAT proteins also contain a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD), which mediates binding to the DNA core sequence (A/T)GGAAA(A/N)(A/T/C)N [2]. In addition to the DNA-binding and regulatory domains, NFAT proteins include two transactivation domains (TAD) located at the N- and C-termini [2], [3]. These regions show relatively low sequence conservation among NFAT family members and may confer different regulatory ability of gene expression\n",
      "NFAT transcription factors are well-characterized for their role in the regulation of genes related to immune responses, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-13, IL-21, IL-22, GM-CSF and interferon-γ [2], [4]. However, NFAT proteins have also been reported to regulate a wide range of genes involved in cell differentiation [5], cell cycle [6], [7], [8] and apoptosis [9], [10], [11]. Due to their high sequence conservation in the NHR and DBD, NFAT members play some overlapping roles in gene regulation [12], [13]. Nevertheless, non-redundant roles are evident in the phenotypes observed in individual NFAT knockout mice. Six-month old NFAT1 deficient mice show lymphocyte hyper-proliferation and an increased size of lymphoid organs [14], [15], [16]. In addition, mice lacking NFAT1 show retarded thymic involution and a reduction in the deletion of activated CD4+ T cells, indicating a possible defect in activation-induced cell death (AICD) [16]. In contrast, NFAT2 deficient mice die before day 14.5 of gestation due to a failure to develop normal cardiac valves and septa [17], [18]. However, in the RAG complementation system, NFAT2 deficient T cells show impaired proliferation and secretion of IL-4 [19]. The divergent roles of NFAT members have been further characterized elsewhere [20]. It has previously been shown that NFAT1 and NFAT2 have opposing effects in tumorigenesis [20]. The constitutively active form of NFAT1 (CA-NFAT1) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and inhibits H-rasV12-induced transformation [20]. On the other hand, CA-NFAT2 induces cell transformation and tumor growth in allograft models [20], [21]. Interestingly, the long C-terminus TAD (TAD-C) of NFAT1 was shown to be essential for the divergent phenotypes induced by NFAT1 and NFAT2 [20]. In fact, the induction of apoptosis by NFAT1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts is dependent on its TAD-C [20]\n",
      "The NFAT1 TAD-C is composed of 248 amino acid residues and extends from amino acid residue 679 to 927. Here, we investigated the amino acid residues and putative domains of NFAT1 TAD-C that are required for NFAT1-induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. We found at least two regions of the NFAT1 TAD-C that confer the pro-apoptotic activity of NFAT1. These regions comprise amino acids 699 to 734 and 819 to 850 from NFAT1. We also showed that NFAT1 TAD-C is unable to induce apoptosis by itself and requires a functional NFAT DBD. Furthermore, we showed that when fused to NFAT1 TAD-C, NFAT2, an NFAT member associated with cell transformation [20], [21], induces apoptosis in fibroblasts. Together, these results suggest that the NFAT1 TAD-C includes NFAT death domains that mediate the induction of apoptosis by different NFAT members\n",

      "Plasmid Construction\n",
      "The retroviral expression vector pLIRES-EGFP was used to express CA-NFAT1 (Figure S1), CA-NFAT2 (Figure S1), CA-NFAT1-MutDBD, CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 chimera and each CA-NFAT1 construct described below. The plasmids pLIRES-EGFP, pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT1, pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT1Δ699-927 (pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT1ΔC) and pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT2/α have been previously described [20], [22]. To clone the CA-NFAT1 constructs CA-NFAT1Δ759-927, CA-NFAT1Δ819-927 and CA-NFAT1Δ889-927 with TAD-C deletions into the retroviral vector pLIRES-EGFP, we amplified portions of CA-NFAT1 by PCR (to amino acid residues 758, 818 or 888, respectively) using an anti-sense primer adapted with an EcoRV restriction site. The amplicon was cleaved by XhoI and EcoRV and inserted into pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT1 cleaved by XhoI and NruI. These constructs were made using pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT1 as a backbone to maintain the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 T antigen located at the C-terminus. The CA-NFAT1 constructs CA-NFAT1Δ699-758, CA-NFAT1Δ699-818, CA-NFAT1Δ699-850, CA-NFAT1Δ699-888 and CA-NFAT1Δ735-850 were constructed by inserting an HpaI restriction site within CA-NFAT1 at two points of interest corresponding to the amino acid positions specified in their names with the GeneTailor Site Directed Mutagenesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Then, the mutated CA-NFAT1 was cleaved by HpaI and ligated, thereby deleting the amino acids residues between the HpaI sites. NFAT1 691-927 cDNA was amplified by PCR, using CA-NFAT1 as a template and a sense primer adapted with a new initiation codon. Later, this amplicon was inserted into the retroviral vector pLIRES-EGFP. The CA-NFAT2 TAD-C NFAT1 chimera was constructed in two steps. First, the NFAT1-TAD-C cDNA was amplified by PCR using pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT1 as template and a sense primer adapted with an XhoI restriction site and cloned into the retroviral vector pLIRES-EGFP, creating pLIRES-EGFP-NFAT1-TAD-C. Second, the CA-NFAT2 cDNA was amplified by PCR until the end of its DBD using pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT2/α as a template and an anti-sense primer adapted with an XhoI restriction site and cloned in-frame into pLIRES-EGFP-NFAT1-TAD-C, constructing pLIRES-EGFP-CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1. The CA-NFAT1-MutDBD was constructed by mutating the amino acids residues of arginine, tyrosine and glutamate in positions 423, 426 and 429, respectively, to alanine, using the GeneTailor Site-Directed Mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). These amino acid residues from the highly conserved recognition loop present in the DBD have been shown to be essential for DNA contact [23]. All of the constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. All of the primer sequences are available upon request\n",

The infected cells were incubated at 37°C for an additional 24 h and trypsinized, and the efficiency of transduction was assessed by enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression using flow cytometry analysis. For the CA-NFAT1 and NFAT1 691-927 co-expression experiments, cells were first infected with NFAT 691-927 expression vector, and 48 h after the infection, co-infected with CA-NFAT1 or empty vector. The efficiency of transduction was analyzed for NFAT1 691-927 expression by EGFP expression prior to the second round of infection and for CA-NFAT1 using intracellular staining with the NFAT1 polyclonal antibody anti-67.1 [24] and rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) by flow cytometric analyses.

      "CA-NFAT1 Expression in NIH3T3 Fibroblasts Induces Apoptosis\n",
      "To study the role of the NFAT1 TAD-C in NFAT1-induced cell death, we used the previously described constitutively active form of NFAT1 isoform C (CA-NFAT1) [20], [26]. CA-NFAT1 has several mutations of serine residues to alanine in the NHR that prevent its phosphorylation and consequent inactivation (Figure S1). Expression analysis showed that the CA-NFAT1 is restricted to the nucleus and is able to transactivate an NFAT responsive promoter in a luciferase gene-reporter assay allowing the analysis of the phenotype induced by CA-NFAT1 in the absence of external stimuli (data not shown). Retroviral transduction was used to introduce CA-NFAT1 into NIH3T3 cells, and >80% transduction was regularly achieved (data not shown)\n",
      "To evaluate the induction of apoptosis by NFAT1, NIH3T3 cells were infected with empty vector (control) or a CA-NFAT1-expressing vector. First, proliferation was assessed by crystal violet incorporation, which correlates with total cell number. While NIH3T3 cells transduced with empty vector proliferated until confluence, CA-NFAT1-expressing cells had low proliferation levels and showed a reduction in total cell number (Figure 1A). Next, to assess whether the low proliferation levels observed in CA-NFAT1-expressing NIH3T3 cells reflects a reduction in the number of cells entering the cell cycle, we evaluated the cell cycle profile 24 hours after plating by propidium iodide staining. Cell cycle analysis revealed that CA-NFAT1 expression arrested cells at G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (Figure 1B)\n",

      "In addition to a low proliferation rate, we also observed a reduction in the total number of CA-NFAT1-expressing cells. Thus, we next assessed the presence of apoptotic features in NIH3T3 cells, as NFAT1 has been reported to induce the expression of apoptotic genes [9], [10], [11]. The sub-G0 DNA content of NIH3T3 cells infected with the empty vector or CA-NFAT1-expressing vector was evaluated by propidium iodide staining to examine DNA fragmentation. As shown in Figures 1C and 1D, control cells showed a low percentage of cells with sub-G0 DNA content. On the other hand, 48 hours after plating, approximately 30% of the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells had sub-G0 DNA content (Figure 1C and 1D), suggesting that CA-NFAT1 expression induces apoptosis of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. To better characterize the phenotype induced by CA-NFAT1, we assessed pyknotic nuclei formation, another indication of apoptosis. In agreement with the sub-G0 DNA content analysis, we observed pyknotic nuclei formation in CA-NFAT1-expressing NIH3T3 cells, while the control cells did not contain pyknotic nuclei as determined by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1E). Furthermore, the expression of CA-NFAT1 in NIH3T3 cells resulted in high phosphatidylserine exposure, another well-known feature of apoptosis (Figure 1F). Approximately 75% of the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells were positive for annexin-V 24 hours after plating (Figure 1F). In contrast, a low percentage of cells infected with empty retrovirus was positive for annexin-V (Figure 1F). Together, these data suggest that CA-NFAT1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NIH3T3 fibroblasts\n",
      "The Deletion of Amino Acid Residues 699 to 850 of the NFAT1 TAD-C Abolishes CA-NFAT1-induced Apoptosis\n",
      "The NFAT transactivation domains are not well conserved among NFAT family members [2], and the NFAT1 C-terminus transactivation (NFAT1 TAD-C) domain has been shown to be responsible for some of the differences of NFAT-mediated gene regulation [11], [27], [28]. Indeed, we have previously shown that the ability of CA-NFAT1 to induce apoptosis is dependent on its TAD-C [20]. However, it is not known which amino acid residues of the TAD-C are required for CA-NFAT1-induced apoptosis. To better understand the role of the TAD-C in NFAT1-induced apoptosis, we mapped the TAD-C amino acids residues required by NFAT1 to induce apoptosis. To this end, we constructed several CA-NFAT1 truncated proteins that lack different regions of the NFAT1 TAD-C. The CA-NFAT1 truncated proteins were named according to the amino acid residues deleted. All of the CA-NFAT1 truncated protein showed similar expression levels and had the expected molecular weight (Figure S2)\n",
      "To evaluate the ability of these CA-NFAT1 truncated proteins to induce apoptosis, we performed sub-G0 DNA content analysis of NIH3T3 cells expressing each construct. First, we observed that CA-NFAT1Δ699-927, which lacks the TAD-C, completely lost the ability to induce apoptosis, in contrast to full length CA-NFAT1, indicating that the NFAT1 TAD-C is essential for induction of apoptosis by CA-NFAT1 in our model (Figure 2A and 2B). On the other hand, CA-NFAT1Δ759-927 induced apoptosis, similar to CA-NFAT1, indicating that the amino acid residues required for CA-NFAT1-mediated apoptosis are between amino acids 699 to 758 (Figure 2A). However, the truncated protein CA-NFAT1Δ699-758, which lacks amino acids 699 to 758, was still able to induce apoptosis, suggesting the existence of multiple regions of the NFAT1 TAD-C that play a role in NFAT1-mediated apoptosis (Figure 2A). This hypothesis was supported by the phenotypes induced by CA-NFAT1Δ699-850 and CA-NFAT1Δ699-818. CA-NFAT1Δ699-850 failed to induce apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells, similar to CA-NFAT1Δ699-927 (Figure 2A and 2B). On the other hand, CA-NFAT1Δ699-818 induced a moderate degree of cell death when compared to the full-length CA-NFAT1, indicating that amino acids 819 to 850 also play a role in NFAT1-induced apoptosis (Figure 2A). Next, we added 35 amino acid residues from positions 699 to 734 to the CA-NFAT1Δ699-850 construct, creating CA-NFAT1Δ735-850. CA-NFAT1Δ735-850 induced high levels of apoptosis, similar to the full-length CA-NFAT1 (Figure 2A). Together, these results showed that the removal of amino acids 699 to 850 prevents the induction of apoptosis by CA-NFAT1 and suggest that there are at least two domains within TAD-C, between amino acids 699 to 734 and 819 to 850, which mediate CA-NFAT1-induced apoptosis. To further investigate the role of these two domains located between amino acids 699 and 850, we constructed a CA-NFAT1 truncated protein containing only amino acids 699 to 850 from TAD-C (CA-NFAT1 DD699-850) and assessed its ability to induce apoptosis by sub-G0 DNA content analysis. When expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, CA-NFAT1 DD699-850 induced apoptosis similarly to CA-NFAT1 (Figure 3A and 3B). CA-NFAT1 DD699-850 expression also reduced proliferation in a CA-NFAT1-like manner (Figure 3C). Therefore, these results suggest that this region of TAD-C plays a critical role in NFAT1-induced apoptosis\n",

      "We also assessed whether there are different roles in apoptosis for NFAT1 splice variants that are divergent in their TAD-C. NFAT1 isoforms B and C are the predominant isoforms in T cells [25]. NFAT1 isoform B diverges in its TAD-C from NFAT1 isoform C at amino acid residue 907. Despite this divergence, sub-G0 DNA content analysis indicated that the constitutively active form of NFAT1 isoform B induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells in a manner similar to CA-NFAT1 isoform C (data not shown). This result suggests that both NFAT1 isoforms B and C induce apoptosis and corroborates our conclusion that the NFAT1 TAD-C region required to induce apoptosis is located between amino acids 699 to 850. Moreover, we also evaluated the role of non-constitutively active form of NFAT1 protein on trigger apoptosis. As shown in Figure S3, wild-type NFAT1 was not able to induce apoptosis when expressed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts upon stimulation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin. However, we cannot rule out the role of NFAT1 protein in apoptosis induction, since the PMA plus ionomycin stimulation may trigger survival pathways that could prevent cell death [29]. Furthermore, this result may indicate that sustained activity of NFAT1 is required for induction of cell death\n",
      "In addition to the suppression of apoptosis, deletion of the NFAT1 TAD-C has been shown to induce hyper-proliferation in fibroblasts [20]. To assess whether the removal of amino acids 699 to 850 of CA-NFAT1 induces hyper-proliferation, NIH3T3 cells infected with empty vector, CA-NFAT1, CA-NFAT1Δ699-850 or CA-NFAT1Δ699-927 were analyzed for proliferation. This assay revealed that CA-NFAT1Δ699-927, which lacks the NFAT1 TAD-C, and CA-NFAT1Δ699-850, which fails to induce apoptosis, were able to induce hyper-proliferation of NIH3T3 cells (Figure 2B and 2C). The CA-NFAT1Δ699-927- and CA-NFAT1Δ699-850-expressing cells proliferated beyond confluence, while the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells did not (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results further support the role of amino acid residues 699 to 850 in NFAT1-induced apoptosis and suggest that there is a duality of NFAT1 that regulates both proliferation and cell death\n",
      "Overexpression of the NFAT1 C-terminus Peptide is Unable to Prevent CA-NFAT1-mediated Apoptosis\n",
      "The apoptosis induced by CA-NFAT1 is dependent on amino acid residues 699 to 850 of the NFAT1 TAD-C (Figure 2), however, it is unclear whether the NFAT1 TAD-C alone can induce apoptosis. To assess this hypothesis, we constructed a retroviral vector expressing the NFAT1 C-terminus peptide, NFAT1 691-927. This protein was fused to the nuclear localization signal of the SV40 T antigen for constitutive localization in the nucleus (data not shown). A schematic alignment of NFAT1 and NFAT1 691-927 is shown in Figure 4A. Next, NIH3T3 cells were infected with empty vector or CA-NFAT1- or NFAT1 691-927-expressing vectors, and the cells were subjected to proliferation assays. We observed that the NFAT1 691-927-expressing cells and control cells proliferated until confluence, in contrast to the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells, indicating that NFAT1 691-927 is unable to induce apoptosis (Figure 4B). These results were later confirmed by sub-G0 DNA content analysis. The NFAT1 691-927-expressing cells had a low percentage of cells with sub-G0 DNA content, which was similar to control cells (Figure 4C and 4D). However, approximately 30% of the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells had sub-G0 DNA content 48 hours after plating (Figure 4C and 4D).

      "NFAT transcription factors interact with several transcription partners that are important integrators of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway with other signaling pathways [1]. The induction of apoptosis by CA-NFAT1 could be dependent on interaction between the NFAT1 TAD-C and an NFAT partner. Therefore, we hypothesized that NFAT1 691-927 may act as a dominant negative of CA-NFAT1 by competing for the binding to an NFAT partner. To test this hypothesis, NIH3T3 cells were infected with empty vector or the NFAT1 691-927 vector, and co-infected with empty vector or the CA-NFAT1-expressing vector 48 hours later. As shown in Figures 4E and 4F, the NIH3T3 cells that were co-infected with empty retrovirus and CA-NFAT1-expressing cells revealed low levels of proliferation and high levels of DNA fragmentation. Similarly, the NIH3T3 cells that were co-infected with CA-NFAT1 and NFAT1 691-927 vectors displayed low proliferation (Figure 4E) and high percentages of cells with sub-G0 DNA content (Figure 4F), indicating that NFAT1 691-927 does not act as a dominant negative of CA-NFAT1\n",
      "The Induction of Apoptosis by CA-NFAT1 is Dependent on DNA Binding\n",
      "The main function of the NFAT family members is to regulate the expression of genes. It has been postulated that NFAT proteins depend entirely on their ability to bind to DNA to regulate gene expression. Therefore, to test whether CA-NFAT1-induced apoptosis is dependent on NFAT1-mediated transcriptional activation, we constructed a CA-NFAT1 mutant that is unable to bind to DNA, CA-NFAT1 MutDBD. A schematic representation of CA-NFAT1 MutDBD is shown in Figure 5A. CA-NFAT1 MutDBD expression in NIH3T3 cells was confirmed by Western Blot (Figure 5B). Then, to confirm that the NFAT1 MutDBD cannot bind DNA, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Figure 5C, wild-type NFAT1 DBD was able to bind to DNA in a dose-dependent manner, while NFAT1 MutDBD was unable to bind to DNA at any of the concentrations tested. Further, luciferase gene reporter assays were performed to confirm that the CA-NFAT1 MutDBD cannot activate gene expression. While CA-NFAT1 induced transactivation of an NFAT-responsive luciferase promoter that was 130-fold higher than that of the control, the empty vector and CA-NFAT1 MutDBD induced similarly low levels of transactivation, indicating that CA-NFAT1 MutDBD is unable to bind DNA and transactivate NFAT-responsive promoters (Figure 5D)\n",

      "Fusion of the NFAT1 TAD-C to CA-NFAT2 Confers the Ability to Induce Apoptosis\n",
      "The NFAT transactivation domains have low conservation among NFAT family members and may confer different gene expression regulatory abilities. It has previously been shown that NFAT1 and NFAT2 have opposing effects on cell proliferation and death [20]. CA-NFAT1 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NIH3T3 fibroblasts [20], while CA-NFAT2 induces cell proliferation and protects cells from dying [20], [21]. The NFAT2 protein possesses a short TAD-C, and the long C-terminus of NFAT1 has been shown to be essential for the divergent phenotypes induced by NFAT1 and NFAT2 [20]. Thus, we assessed whether the NFAT1 TAD-C could induce apoptosis when fused to CA-NFAT2 and reverse the phenotype induced by CA-NFAT2 in NIH3T3 cells\n",

As shown in Figure 6B, the anti-NFAT1 antibody that recognizes the NFAT1 TAD-C recognized both CA-NFAT1 and CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 (left panel), and the anti-NFAT2 antibody detected the expression of CA-NFAT2 and CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 (right panel), indicating that the CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 chimeric protein is expressed in NIH3T3 cells\n",

As shown in Figure 6C, the CA-NFAT2-expressing cells proliferated beyond confluence, in contrast to the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells. Interestingly, the CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1-expressing cells had low rates of proliferation and a reduction in total cell number, similar to the CA-NFAT1-expressing cells (Figure 6C). These results demonstrated that CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 is able to induce a phenotype similar to that induced by CA-NFAT1 in NIH3T3 cells. We next determined whether this chimeric protein is also able to trigger apoptosis. Sub-G0 DNA content analysis revealed that CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 induced apoptosis similar to CA-NFAT1 (Figure 6D and 6E). In contrast, a low number of CA-NFAT2-expressing cells had sub-G0 DNA content (Figure 6D and 6E).

      "Discussion\n",
      "In this study, we showed that CA-NFAT1 expression induces apoptosis in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, as evidenced by cell features such as DNA fragmentation, pyknotic nuclei formation and phosphatidylserine exposure (Figure 1). Furthermore, our results identified a specific region of the NFAT1 TAD-C, amino acids 699 to 850, that is essential for the apoptosis induced by CA-NFAT1 (Figure 2 and 3). Although this region is still large, comprising 152 amino acids, our data suggest that the NFAT1 TAD-C includes at least two death domains between amino acids 699 to 734 and 819 to 850 that mediate the pro-apoptotic function of NFAT1 independently of other regions of TAD-C. Indeed, the truncated protein CA-NFAT1Δ699-850 was unable to induce apoptosis, while CA-NFAT1Δ735-850 and CA-NFAT1Δ699-818 induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells (Figure 2). Corroborating these results, CA-NFAT1 DD699-850, a CA-NFAT1 construct that contains only the TAD-C amino acids 699 to 850, induced apoptosis similarly to CA-NFAT1 (Figure 3). In addition, we also observed that CA-NFAT1Δ699-927 and CA-NFAT1Δ699-850 drove the NIH3T3 cells to proliferate beyond confluence (Figure 2C). This result suggests that NFAT1 can induce proliferation in the absence of the amino acid residues that are required for the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that NFAT2 isoform α, an NFAT member that possess a short TAD-C, is involved in cell transformation [20], [21]. The constitutively active form of NFAT2 isoform α has been reported to induce colony formation, deregulation of contact inhibition and tumor growth in a mouse allotransplant tumor model [20], [21]. Taken together, these studies suggest that there is a dichotomy between NFAT members that is mediated by their TAD-C. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a chimeric NFAT2 protein (CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1). Interestingly, CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1 reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells in a manner similar to CA-NFAT1 (Figure 6). Therefore, this result confirms that the NFAT1 TAD-C is a central mediator of the NFAT1 pro-apoptotic function\n",
      "To regulate gene expression, NFAT proteins interact with several proteins, such as transcriptional activators, co-activators and repressors [1]. Some of these interactions have been shown to be mediated by the TADs. Activator protein-1 (AP-1), the most well-characterized NFAT transcription partner, was first reported to interact with NFAT through its DBD [30]. However, functional interaction between AP-1 and NFAT1 has been shown to occur at the NFAT1 TAD-C [31]. NFAT1 also interacts with the IRF2BP2 transcriptional repressor through the TAD-C [28]. Moreover, the NFAT1 N-terminal TAD (TAD-N) interacts with other NFAT partners, such as p300, a well-known transcriptional co-activator [32]. Despite the low sequence similarity, the NFAT TADs are important structures that mediate the interaction between NFAT and partner proteins and are therefore very important for NFAT-mediated gene regulation. In this study, we observed that a NFAT1 TAD-C peptide (NFAT1 691-927) was unable to prevent CA-NFAT1-induced apoptosis by acting as dominant negative (Figure 4), suggesting that CA-NFAT1 may not interact with an NFAT partner protein through its TAD-C to induce apoptosis\n",
      "The NFAT1 TAD-C appears to be particularly important for the regulation of some apoptotic genes. Nur77, an activator of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, has been shown to induce apoptosis in immature timocytes and several types of cancer cells [33], [34], [35]. Interestingly, Nur77 is able to convert Bcl-2, a well-known anti-apoptotic protein that prevents the release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria, into a pro-apoptotic protein [36]. The interaction of NFAT1 and the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) through the NFAT1 TAD-C is required for activation of the Nur77 promoter [11]. Interestingly, this regulation was shown to be independent of NFAT1 binding to DNA [11]. Here, we assessed whether a mutant CA-NFAT1 that is unable to bind to DNA could induce apoptosis. Our analysis showed that CA-NFAT1 MutDBD did not induce apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells (Figure 5). This result demonstrated that binding to DNA and the transcriptional activity of CA-NFAT1 are required for induction of apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells\n",
      "NFAT1 is expressed in peripheral T cells, where it is involved in terminating the immune response by AICD. AICD is a form of apoptosis that is triggered by the activation of the extrinsic pathway by a death ligand. The NFAT1 TAD-C is important for the activation of one of these death ligands, the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) gene. NFAT1 binds to the κ3 promoter element of the TNF-α gene and activates TNF-α transcription [9]. The induction of the TNFα promoter by NFAT1 has been shown to be dependent on its TAD-C, as NFAT1 is able to transactivate the TNF-α promoter, while NFAT2 is not [27]. Interestingly, NFAT2 is only able to induce the TNF-α promoter when fused to the NFAT1 TAD-C [27]. The role of the NFAT1 TAD-C in the regulation of TNF-α has not been determined. Regulation of TNF-α by NFAT1 may explain the phenotype observed in CA-NFAT1-expressing and CA-NFAT2-TAD-C-NFAT1-expressing cells (Figs. 1, 2 and 6). As TNF-α is most commonly secreted, we assessed whether conditioned media from CA-NFAT1-expressing NIH3T3 cells induced apoptosis in wild-type NIH3T3 cells. Preliminary results from our group showed that supernatants from CA-NFAT1-expressing cells did not induce apoptosis in wild-type NIH3T3 cells (data not published). However, further studies are required to determine whether TNF-α is implicated in CA-NFAT1-mediated apoptosis in NIH3T3 cells\n",
      "AICD can also be activated by TRAIL and FasL. The TRAIL promoter possesses several putative NFAT binding sites [37]. In addition, TRAIL expression in stimulated T cells is sensitive to cyclosporine, a well-known inhibitor of calcineurin, suggesting a role for NFAT in its regulation [38]. However, no studies have reported direct regulation of TRAIL by NFAT1. FasL belongs to the tumor necrosis factor family and plays an important role in many immunological processes [39]. NFAT1 protein from nuclear extracts of activated T cells has been shown to bind two sites within the FasL promoter [10], and ectopic NFAT1 expression activates the FasL promoter [40]. However, there is no evidence of a role for the NFAT1 TAD-C in the regulation of the FasL promoter\n",
      "Although the TADs harbor the main differences of the NFAT members, the contributions of the TADs to NFAT-induced phenotypes are not well defined. Here, we showed that the NFAT1 TAD-C includes at least two NFAT death domains that mediate the pro-apoptotic function of NFAT1 and can also confer this function to another NFAT member. Apoptosis is implicated in several pathological conditions, including cancer. The evasion of mechanism of apoptosis is considered one of the cancer hallmarks [41]. Over the past two decades, several studies have demonstrated the roles of NFAT transcription factors in the regulation of cancer and have revealed that the functions of the NFAT members are not redundant [42]. NFAT1 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene, whereas NFAT2 has been reported to be an oncogene [20], [21], [43]. Thus, it appears that NFAT1 and NFAT2 have opposing effects. In our study, we showed that the opposing effects are mediated partially by a specific region of the NFAT1 TAD-C located between amino acids 699 to 850. The tumor suppressor activity of NFAT1 is dependent on its TAD-C [20] and may be conferred by NFAT1 TAD-C to another NFAT member, including a NFAT members described as a oncogene, such as NFAT2. Further studies will be necessary to determine the mechanisms by which NFAT1 induces apoptosis and which genes are differentially regulated by NFAT proteins in this context\n",

For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com.The RNA exosome is responsible for a wide variety of RNA processing and degradation reactions. The activity and specificity of the RNA exosome is thought to be controlled by a number of cofactors. Mtr4 is an essential RNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase that is required for all of the nuclear functions of the RNA exosome. The crystal structure of Mtr4 uncovered a domain that is conserved in the RNA exosome cofactors Mtr4 and Ski2 but not in other helicases, suggesting it has an important role related to exosome activation. Rrp6 provides the nuclear exosome with one of its three nuclease activities, and previous findings suggested that the arch domain is specifically required for Rrp6 functions. Here, we report that the genetic interactions between the arch domain of Mtr4 and Rrp6 cannot be explained by the arch domain solely acting in Rrp6-dependent processing reactions. Specifically, we show that the arch domain is not required for all Rrp6 functions, and that the arch domain also functions independently of Rrp6. Finally, we show that the arch domain of Ski2, the cytoplasmic counterpart of Mtr4, is required for Ski2’s function, thereby confirming that the arch domains of these cofactors function independently of Rrp6\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "RNA maturation from the primary transcript to the mature active molecule includes a variety of modifications and cleavages. Mistakes at any step in the maturation process result in aberrant RNAs that are generally targeted for rapid degradation. The eukaryotic RNA exosome is one of the ribonucleases required for maturation of a variety of RNAs and for the degradation of aberrant RNAs. Specifically, the exosome promotes the processing of the 5.8S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), as well as small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and snRNA precursors. Moreover, the exosome degrades byproducts of gene expression, including the 5′ external transcribed spacer (5′ ETS) of pre-rRNA, introns and aberrant RNAs such as hypomodified transfer RNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that lack a stop codon (1–6)\n",
      "The core of the eukaryotic RNA exosome is composed of nine subunits (7–11). Each of the nine subunits is essential, but catalytically inactive. Rather than being directly responsible for catalysis, they are critical for the exosome structure and are predicted to interact with substrate RNAs. Six of these subunits form a trimer of heterodimers that produce a channel whereby RNA can enter (PH ring) (8,10,12). Three 'cap proteins' have conserved putative RNA-binding domains that cluster around the entry site into the PH ring (7,13,14). The exosome core associates with two ribonuclease subunits, Rrrp44 and Rrp6. Rrp44 is on the opposite side of the channel at the putative RNA exit side of the PH ring (15,16). The Rrp44 subunit has both endonuclease and exonuclease domains, and provides the exosome with its two catalytic functions. Rrp6 is present only in a subset of the exosome complexes and is restricted to the nucleus. It thus provides the nuclear form of the exosome with a third catalytic site (7). The available exosome X-ray structures do not include Rrp6, and how it is oriented relative to the PH ring and the Rrp44 active sites is currently unknown\n",
      "The core subunits of the exosome are required for all exosome activities, but Rrp6 and a number of exosome cofactors are required for only a subset of its activities. Therefore, these cofactors appear to provide substrate specificity to the RNA exosome. Among the cofactors, Mtr4 and Ski2, collectively, are required for all exosome activities; Mtr4 is required for all of the nuclear functions, whereas Ski2 is required for all of the cytoplasmic functions. Mtr4 and Ski2 are related RNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatases (ATPases) (3,17,18). Mtr4 is also one of the subunits of the TRAMP complex, and as part of TRAMP, Mtr4 is thought to be involved in the degradation of aberrant transcripts (19,20). TRAMP is composed of Mtr4, a non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (either Trf4 or Trf5) and a putative RNA-binding protein (either Air1 or Air2) (19,20). Other exosome functions such as 5.8S rRNA maturation require Mtr4, but not the other TRAMP subunits (19)\n",
      "The crystal structures of Mtr4 and Ski2 have been solved (17,21,22). This revealed that Mtr4 shares two RecA domains, a winged helix domain and a C-terminal domain with the extended family of Ski2-like RNA and DNA helicases that are involved in a variety of cellular processes (21,22). We will refer to these four domains as the core helicase domains. In addition to these conserved helicase features, the Mtr4 and Ski2 structures revealed two features that appear to be restricted to these two exosome-associated RNA helicases (17,21,22). First, analysis of surface-exposed residues revealed a large conserved area that surrounds the site where the 3′ end of the RNA emerges from the helicase core. The cap proteins of the exosome have a conserved surface similar in diameter, and we have speculated that the bottom of Mtr4 and Ski2 may form the binding site for the cap proteins of the exosome (21). The second Mtr4 feature that was resolved by the structure is a novel domain that is inserted into the winged helix domain and rises above the core helicase domains of Mtr4 on the RNA entry side (i.e. opposite to the conserved bottom surface). This 'arch' domain is conserved in all Mtr4 and Ski2 orthologs, but does adopt different conformations in the two published Mtr4 structures and in the Ski2 structure (17,21,22). The arch domain can be deleted from Mtr4 without any effect on its in vitro RNA-dependent ATPase or RNA-unwinding activity (21,22). In vivo, an mtr4-archless mutant complements an mtr4Δ but with a slow growth phenotype. The degradation of the 5′ ETS and the processing of the 5.8S rRNA are both defective in the mtr4-archless mutant (21). Comparison of the mtr4-archless defects with the phenotypes of strains lacking either Rrp44 endonuclease, Rrp44 exonuclease or Rrp6 exonuclease activities revealed a striking similarity between mtr4-archless and the rrp6Δ strains (21). We therefore previously suggested that the arch domain was required for Rrp6 function\n",
      "Several questions remain regarding exosome and Mtr4 function. What is the specific role of the arch domain of Mtr4 in terms of exosome-mediated processing and degradation? Is the arch restricted to recruiting Rrp6? To answer these questions we have analyzed the in vivo function of the Mtr4 arch domain in more detail. Here, we show that although the arch is necessary for specific Rrp6 functions, the arch has some functions independent of, and maybe redundant with, Rrp6. Additionally, although the arch domain is not required for the protein–protein interactions with the TRAMP complex subunit Trf5, the absence of the arch can affect Trf5 interaction. Finally, we further confirm that the arch domain functions beyond Rrp6, by performing the first in vivo analysis of the ski2-archless mutant\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "The arch domain of Mtr4 is not required for all Rrp6 functions\n",
      "We have previously shown that mtr4-archless has RNA processing and degradation defects that resemble those in an rrp6Δ strain. An interesting hypothesis was that the arch domain of Mtr4 was required for all Rrp6 functions. To test whether all of the Rrp6 functions require the arch domain of Mtr4, we analyzed the snoRNA snR33. snoRNA processing requires the core exosome and Rrp6 in separate steps. In rrp6Δ strains, many snoRNAs are extended by three or four nucleotides. Some of these extra nucleotides are encoded in the snoRNA gene, whereas others are added by the TRAMP complex (2,5,26). In addition to these rrp6-specific short 3′ extensions, several different mutations in the core exosome, as well as rrp6Δ, lead to snoRNA species that carry longer encoded 3′ extensions, and some of these 3′ extended species are polyadenylated in a process that requires both TRAMP and Pap1 (2,5,26,27). To test whether either catalytic activity of Rrp44 was involved in snoRNA processing, we analyzed mutants with a point mutation in the Rrp44 exonuclease site (the rrp44-exo-mutant) or with a point mutation in the Rrp44 endonuclease site (the rrp44-endo-mutant). Figure 1 shows that rrp44-exo-accumulates long 3' extended snR33 species, whereas the rrp44-endo-mutant has no defect in the maturation of snR33. Unlike what was seen for 5.8S rRNA processing and 5' ETS degradation, the effect of mtr4-archless on processing of snR33 does not resemble the effect of rrp6Δ. The mtr4-archless strain does not accumulate snoRNAs with 2–3 nt extensions or long polyadenylated snoRNAs. We conclude that the arch domain of Mtr4 is only required for specific Rrp6 functions\n",
      "Figure 1. mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ have distinct effects on snoRNA processing. RNA was isolated from each of the strains indicated and analyzed by northern blotting of a urea polyacrylamide gel. The blot was perform using the probes complementary to the mature version of snR33 (middle panel), sequences downstream of the mature snR33 (top panel) and SRP for loading control (bottom panel), described in the oligonucleotide table\n",
      "Synthetic defects indicate that the arch domain of Mtr4 can function independently of Rrp6\n",
      "To further resolve the relation between the functions of the arch domain and Rrp6, we used a genetic analysis and compared growth of the rrp6Δ and mtr4-archless mutants with the growth of an rrp6Δ mtr4-archless double mutant. To do this, we transformed isogenic mtr4Δ and mtr4Δ rrp6Δ strains that contained an MTR4 URA3 plasmid with LEU2 plasmids that contained either MTR4, mtr4-archless or an empty vector. These double transformants were then serially diluted and spotted onto 5-FOA-containing media to select for cells that had lost the MTR4 URA3 plasmid. Two observations suggest that the slow growth of mtr4-archless is not caused by a defect in Rrp6 activation. First, if the slow growth of mtr4-archless was caused by reduced activity of Rrp6, then rrp6Δ should lead to a growth defect at least as severe as mtr4-archless. We did not observe this, and instead, the mtr4-archless growth defect is much more severe than that of rrp6Δ (compare the 2nd and 4th rows of Figure 2). Second, the hypothesis that the arch is needed to assist Rrp6 predicts that deleting the arch in a strain already lacking Rrp6 would have no additional phenotypic effect. Instead, the rrp6Δ mtr4-archless double mutant grows much slower than either of the single mutants (compare row 5 of Figure 2 to rows 2 and 4). This synthetic growth defect indicates that the arch domain of Mtr4 and Rrp6 has overlapping functions, but that each can function independently of the other\n",
      "Figure 2. mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ have a synthetic growth defect. The mtr4Δ [MTR4, URA3] and mtr4Δ rrp6Δ [MTR4, URA3] strains were each transformed with plasmids encoding either Mtr4, Mtr4-archless or empty vector with the LEU2 selectable marker. Transformants were serially diluted and spotted onto 5-FOA media and control plate (SC-LEU-URA), and growth was assessed. Medium with 5-FOA selects for cells that have lost the URA3 plasmid (namely the WT copy of the MTR4). Therefore, only the MTR4 alleles that support viability will grow on 5-FOA\n",
      "We have previously shown that mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ result in similar 5.8S rRNA processing defects. Specifically, both these mutants accumulate a 5.8S rRNA processing intermediate that retains 30 nt of its 3′ extension. To test whether the synthetic growth defect of an rrp6Δ mtr4-archless mutant was related to this shared rRNA processing defect, we compared 5.8S rRNA processing in the double mutant with that in both single mutants by northern blot analysis. Figure 3 shows that the 5.8S rRNA defect in the double mutant is no more severe than in the single mutants. This is consistent with the suggestion that the arch domain and Rrp6 act in the same pathway, and indicates that the slower growth of the double mutant is not correlated with worsening of this processing defect. Overall, the results of the double mutant analysis suggest that the arch domain of Mtr4 and Rrp6 function in similar pathways, but there is not a complete overlap of these functions\n",
      "Figure 3. The 5.8S rRNA processing defects of mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ are not additive. RNA was isolated from each of the strains indicated and analyzed by northern blotting of a urea polyacrylamide gel. Two rrp6Δ strains are included; lane 3 is an rrp6Δ MTR4 strain, whereas lane 4 is an rrp6Δ mtr4Δ strain complemented with an MTR4 plasmid for direct comparison with lane 5. Northern blot was performed using the probes complementary to 5.8S rRNA and SRP for loading control\n",
      "Over-expression of the core domains of Mtr4 is sufficient to suppress the growth defect of rrp6Δ\n",
      "Previously, a high-copy suppressor screen showed that expressing Mtr4 from a high-copy plasmid reduced the growth defect of the rrp6Δ strain (28). To further understand the genetic interactions between RRP6 and MTR4, we analyzed whether this high-copy suppression required the arch domain of Mtr4. The high-copy suppressor screen was done in a different yeast background strain (W303) from the one used in our previous experiments (BY4742) because rrp6Δ in W303 results in a much more severe growth defect. Particularly, the rrp6Δ strain in the W303 background grows slowly at both 37°C and at room temperature. Thus, to fully understand the genetic interactions between rrp6Δ and mtr4-archless, we expressed either wild-type MTR4 or mtr4-archless from a high-copy plasmid in the wild-type and rrp6Δ W303 strain. Transformants were serially diluted, spotted onto plates and incubated at room temperature (20°C), 30°C and 37°C on media lacking uracil to select for transformants with the high-copy plasmid. Figure 4 shows that over-expression of wild-type and archless Mtr4 fully suppresses the growth defect of rrp6Δ at the non-permissive temperature, indicating that the arch domain is not necessary to restore the specific Rrp6-dependent functions that promote growth at the non-permissive temperature. The western blot in Figure 4b confirms that both Mtr4 and Mtr4-archless are over-expressed at similar levels in this yeast strain\n",
      "Figure 4. Over-expression of the core helicase domains of Mtr4 is sufficient to suppress the growth defect of an rrp6Δ mutant. (a) Wild-type and rrp6Δ strains in the W303 background strain were each transformed with 2µ (high-copy) plasmids encoding Mtr4, Mtr4-archless and empty vector. Transformants were serially diluted and spotted onto media selecting for the 2µ plasmid at the non-permissive temperatures, 20°C and 37°C, or at the permissive temperature 30°C. (b) Western blot analysis confirms that Mtr4 and Mtr4-archless are over-expressed at similar levels\n",
      "Over-expression of Mtr4 restores specific rrp6Δ RNA defects\n",
      "It was previously reported that although over-expressing Mtr4 suppresses the growth defect in an rrp6Δ, it does not restore the defects in processing 5.8S rRNA and the snoRNA snR38. To determine whether other functions were restored in the rrp6Δ strain with each of the over-expressed Mtr4 versions, we performed northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from transformants for each of these strains: rrp6Δ over-expressing Mtr4, rrp6Δ over-expressing Mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ with a high-copy empty vector. Additionally, control strains that had the wild-type RRP6 gene transformed with each of the high-copy plasmids (WT MTR4, mtr4-archless and empty vector) were analyzed. Over-expression of Mtr4 in the rrp6Δ strain did not affect the accumulation of 5.8S + 30 rRNA or snR38 with short 3′ extensions, as previously reported (29). However, in these same strains, the accumulation of longer polyadenylated forms of snR33 was almost completely suppressed (Figure 5b, compare fourth and fifth lanes), and accumulation of 5′ ETS degradation intermediates was partially suppressed (Figure 5a, compare fourth and fifth lanes). Over-expressing mtr4-archless reduced the rrp6Δ defects to a lesser extent than over-expressing wild-type Mtr4 (compare fifth and sixth lanes in Figure 5a and b). Overall, our results suggest that over-expressing Mtr4 in rrp6Δ does not affect the accumulation of snoRNA species with short 3′ extensions but does suppress the accumulation of longer 3′ extended species. Over-expressing mtr4- archless does so to a smaller extent but must suppress some other defects sufficiently to fully restore growth\n",
      "Figure 5. Over-expression of Mtr4 restores specific rrp6Δ defects. RNA was isolated from the WT and the rrp6Δ strains transformed with high-copy plasmids (described in Figure 4). Northern blot was performed using the oligonucleotide probes against (a) 5′ ETS, 5.8S rRNA, (b) pre-snR33, mature snR33, snR38 and SRP described in the oligonucleotide table\n",
      "The arch domain of Ski2 is required to promote the cytoplasmic functions of the exosome\n",
      "Although Ski2 and Mtr4 homology includes both the core helicase domains and the arch domain, the sequence similarity between the two arch domains is low. Moreover, it is not known whether the arch domain of Ski2 is functional. Like in Mtr4, in vitro activities of Ski2-archless are similar to the wild-type enzyme, including the capacity to form a Ski complex with Ski3 and Ski8 (17). Importantly, Ski2 function is independent of Rrp6, and therefore, if the arch domain of Ski2 is functional, it must function independently of Rrp6. Ski2 localizes to the cytoplasm, therefore only promoting the cytoplasmic functions of the exosome, which in turn are independent of the nuclear Rrp6. To investigate the role of the arch domain in one of the cytoplasmic functions of the exosome, we performed two different assays. First, Ski2 is required for one of the two redundant pathways for mRNA decay. Mutations that disrupt SKI2 function are synthetically lethal with mutations that inactivate the decapping enzyme. Therefore, we analyzed whether ski2-archless could rescue the synthetic lethality of the dcp1-2 ski2Δ strain, which contains a temperature-sensitive mutation that inactivates the decapping enzyme (30). As shown in Figure 6, the dcp1-2 ski2Δ synthetic lethality can not be rescued by the ski2-archless plasmid. Importantly, western blotting indicated that Ski2-archless is expressed at levels similar to wild-type Ski2\n",
      "Figure 6. The arch domain of Ski2 is required for the degradation of normal and nonstop mRNAs by the exosome. (a) The dcp1-2 ski2Δ strain was transformed with SKI2, ski2-archless and empty plasmids and grown at either permissive or restrictive temperature (20°C and 37°C, respectively) to assay for defects in general mRNA decay. (b) The ski2Δ strain was transformed with his3-ns reporter and SKI2, ski2-archless and empty vector constructs. The nonstop assay plate lacks histidine, and growth indicates a defective nonstop decay pathway. In both assays, the growth from Ski2-archless resembles the empty vector control, indicating a defect in nonstop mRNA degradation by the exosome. (c) Western blotting with a myc antibody was used to show that Ski2-archless is expressed at similar levels to wild-type Ski2\n",
      "The second assay for Ski2 function is based on the preferential degradation of mRNAs that lack a stop codon (nonstop mRNAs) by the cytoplasmic exosome. A strain with SKI2 deleted in the chromosome was first transformed with the His3-ns reporter plasmid and then with either the SKI2, ski2-archless or empty vector plasmids. In cells with a defect in nonstop decay such as in a ski2Δ, the His3-ns reporter is stable, and such cells are able grow in media lacking histidine. Conversely, cells with a functional Ski2 quickly degrade the aberrant His3-ns mRNA, thereby unable to grow in media lacking the amino acid. The His3-ns growth assay in Figure 6 shows growth in cells expressing the Ski2-archless mutant in plates lacking histidine (non-stop assay, left panel). These two assays indicate that the arch domain of Ski2 is essential for both exosome-mediated functions, nonstop degradation and normal mRNA decay, consistent with the idea that arch domains can act independent of Rrp6 (31)\n",
      "The arch domain of Mtr4 is not required for Trf5 interaction in vivo, but may modulate Trf5–Mtr4 interaction\n",
      "Mtr4 is a subunit of the TRAMP complex but also has TRAMP-independent functions. Previous in vitro reconstitution and co-immunoprecipitation assays did not reveal a role for the arch domain in TRAMP complex formation (22,28). The TRAMP complex was initially identified because the Trf4 and Trf5 subunits were isolated in a Y2H screen using Mtr4 as bait (19). Therefore, we used this assay to test whether the arch domain of Mtr4 was required for Trf5 interaction in vivo. Trf5’s Mtr4-binding region was fused to the activation domain of the Gal4 transcription factor, whereas full-length Mtr4 and Mtr4-archless were independently fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Growth on plates lacking adenine or histidine indicated that there is positive interaction between Trf5 and Mtr4 even when the arch is removed (Figure 7). Thus, as seen in vitro, the arch domain is not required for in vivo interaction with Trf5. Surprisingly, the Mtr4-archless construct provided a more robust Y2H interaction than wild-type Mtr4. The activation of the HIS3 reporter gene in Y2H can be assayed semi-quantitatively on plates containing different concentrations of 3-AT, which is a competitive inhibitor of the His3 enzyme. Using this approach, the Y2H interaction between Trf5 and Mtr4 resulted in growth on plates containing 25 mM, but not 50 mM, 3-AT. Under identical conditions, the interaction between Trf5 and Mtr4-archless was sufficient to provide growth at up to 100 mM 3-AT (data not shown). Additionally, the LacZ reporter gene of the Y2H strains was activated 3-fold more by the Mtr4-archless–Trf5 interaction than the full-length Mtr4–Trf5 interaction (Figure 7). A stronger Y2H interaction can be caused by differences in expression level of the hybrid proteins or by a difference in the strength of the interaction. Using western blot analysis with anti-Mtr4 antibodies, we confirmed that the Gal4-AD-Mtr4 and Gal4-AD-Mtr4-archless proteins are expressed at similar levels, suggesting that the Mtr4-archless protein interacts better with Trf5 in the Y2H assay. As no change in TRAMP complex formation was observed in in vitro reconstitution or co-immunoprecipitation assays (22,28), the enhanced Y2H interaction is unlikely due to a direct change in binding affinity and may reflect involvement of additional proteins not stably associated with TRAMP\n",
      "Figure 7. The arch domain of Mtr4 is not required for the Trf5–Mtr4 binding in vivo. (a) Y2H analysis was performed as explained in the 'Materials and Methods' section. Growth on SC-ADE and SC-HIS + 10 mM 3-AT indicates the physical interaction between the proteins tested. Empty vector were used against each of the proteins tested to control for autoactivation. (b) Quantitation of β-galactosidase expression. Plotted is the mean and standard deviation of triplicate cultures. The background reading obtained with empty vectors of pOAD and pOBD was subtracted.

      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "The crystal structure of Mtr4 revealed a novel arch domain (21,22). In vitro analysis of Mtr4 lacking this domain showed that the arch domain was not required for RNA-dependent ATPase activity, RNA helicase activity or TRAMP complex formation (21,22). However, initial in vivo experiments indicated that mtr4-archless had similar effects to rrp6Δ (21). Based on that observation, the arch domain was proposed to help make RNA substrate accessible to Rrp6, possibly by removal of the RNA from the core exosome (21). Here, we present a more complete description of the genetic interactions between mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ. Several in vivo effects can not be fully explained by the previous hypothesis, suggesting that the arch domain has additional functions independent of Rrp6\n",
      "First, we show that mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ have different effects on snoRNA maturation. The rrp6Δ mutant has previously been shown to accumulate distinct species of snoRNAs with 3′ extensions. rrp6Δ mutants accumulate snoRNAs with short extensions that can include a few A residues added by the TRAMP complex. Additionally, the rrp6Δ strain and other exosome mutants also accumulate some longer 3′ extended snoRNA species that can be polyadenylated (2,5). In contrast to rrp6Δ, the mtr4-archless mutation does not cause the accumulation of either species. Therefore, Rrp6 performs these functions without requiring the arch domain of Mtr4\n",
      "Second, we describe a synthetic growth defect between mtr4-archless and rrp6Δ, indicating that the arch domain of Mtr4 and Rrp6 can both function in the absence of each other. Specifically, if the sole function of the arch domain was to mediate Rrp6 function, deletion of the arch domain should have no further effect in rrp6Δ. The previously described 5.8S rRNA processing defect in rrp6Δ and mtr4-archless was no worse in the double mutant, consistent with the idea that the arch domain and Rrp6 act together in one pathway, but the more severe growth defect of the double mutant suggests that the arch domain has some other Rrp6-independent function\n",
      "Third, we show that over-expressing either full-length Mtr4 or Mtr4-archless can suppress the growth defect of rrp6Δ, suggesting that the function of the core helicase domains of Mtr4 also functionally overlaps with the function of Rrp6. Mtr4 was previously isolated as a high-copy suppressor of rrp6Δ, indicating that Mtr4 has some function that overlaps with that of Rrp6, and that Mtr4 can perform that function in the absence of Rrp6. We show that over-expression of Mtr4-archless also fully suppresses the growth defect of rrp6Δ. It was previously reported that Mtr4 over-expression did not suppress the accumulation of 5.8S + 30 rRNA or the snoRNAs with short TRAMP-generated 3′ extensions. We confirm this, but also show that Mtr4 does suppress some other processing defect of rrp6Δ, including the accumulation of snoRNAs with long poly(A) tails and 5′ ETS degradation intermediates. Mtr4-archless partially suppresses these same defects. This implies that not only do the functions of the arch domain and Rrp6 overlap but also the functions of the core helicase domains on Mtr4 and Rrp6 overlap\n",
      "Finally, we identified that, like Mtr4, the arch domain of Ski2 is important to promote exosome functions. Ski2-archless mutant is not able to stimulate normal and nonstop mRNA degradation by the exosome. This suggests that the arch domains of Mtr4 and Ski2 may have similar roles in assisting some function of the core exosome\n",
      "Overall, our genetic and molecular experiments indicate that Rrp6, the arch domain of Mtr4, and the core helicase domains of Mtr4 interact in different and possibly overlapping pathways that can not currently be explained by one simple model. Instead, we suggest that Mtr4 uses its arch domain and RNA-dependent ATPase activity promiscuously to modulate multiple RNA and protein interactions during RNA exosome processing and degradation rather than for one specific rearrangement\n",

      "NF-κB plays a vital role in cellular immune and inflammatory response, survival, and proliferation by regulating the transcription of various genes involved in these processes. To activate transcription, RelA (a prominent NF-κB family member) interacts with transcriptional co-activators like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 in addition to its cognate κB sites on the promoter/enhancer regions of DNA. The RelA:CBP/p300 complex is comprised of two components—first, DNA binding domain of RelA interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and second, the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of RelA binds to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event of a well-conserved RelA(Ser276) is prerequisite for the former interaction to occur and is considered a decisive factor for the overall RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. The role of the latter interaction in the transcription of RelA-activated genes remains unclear. Here we provide the solution structure of the latter component of the RelA:CBP complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals the folding of RelA–TA2 (a section of TAD) upon binding to TAZ1 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. The structural analysis coupled with the mechanistic studies by mutational and isothermal calorimetric analyses allowed the design of RelA-mutants that selectively abrogated the two distinct components of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Detailed studies of these RelA mutants using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that a major set of the RelA-activated genes, larger than previously believed, is affected by this interaction. We further show how the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through the negative feedback loop of NF-κB pathway. Additionally, chromatin analyses of RelA target gene promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CBP/p300, thus indicating a possible role of CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites\n",
      "Author Summary\n",
      "The NF-κB family of transcription factors regulate the expression of numerous genes involved in the immune response, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. The interaction of the RelA subunit of NF-κB with the general co-activator protein CBP/p300 is vital for RelA-dependent gene transcription. Although the recruitment of RelA to its cognate genomic κB sites for target gene activation is well-established, the involvement of CBP/p300 in this process remains unclear. Through our structure/function-based approach we provide the molecular and functional details of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction and its contribution to the regulation of distinct subsets of target genes. We also show that disruption of this interaction deregulates the NF-κB pathway by interfering with its negative feedback loop. Furthermore, our study indicates a possible reciprocal role for CBP/p300 in the recruitment of RelA to its target gene promoters\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The NF-κB family of inducible transcription factors has emerged as a major player in immune response [1], activating a plethora of immunoregulatory genes upon stimulation. In vertebrates, the family is comprised of five members, namely, RelA (also known as p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52. They exist in various combinations of homo- and hetero-dimers, with RelA:p50 being the most abundant NF-κB dimer present in the cell. All of the family members share a structurally conserved N-terminal rel homology region (RHR), which is responsible for DNA binding and also contains the dimerization domain (DD). RelA, RelB, and c-Rel distinguish themselves from p50 and p52 by possessing the transcriptional activation domain (TAD), which is vital for the transcriptional regulation of the NF-κB-regulated genes. In unstimulated cells, NF-κB is maintained in a latent state in the cytoplasm by the family of Inhibitor-κB (IκB) proteins, which strongly bind to the RHR domain of NF-κB dimers, thereby masking its nuclear localization signal. Upon stimulation, a cascade of signaling events led to the degradation of the IκB proteins, thus releasing the NF-κB dimers, which then enter the nucleus to regulate the transcription of NF-κB-dependent genes. In the nucleus, NF-κB activates transcription by binding to its cognate κB sites in the promoters/enhancers of its target genes [2],[3]. However, mere binding of the NF-κB to its cognate κB sites does not ensure transcriptional initiation, and further requires the assembly of the “basal transcription machinery” on the transcription start site. Assembly of the transcription initiation complex requires NF-κB to interact with the mediator complex, various transcriptional adaptors, and co-activator proteins like CREB-binding protein (CBP) and its paralog p300 [4]–[7]. CBP/p300 are general transcriptional co-activators that help NF-κB bridge with the basal transcription machinery [8]. CBP/p300 interact with a large array of transcription factors to integrate multiple cellular signaling pathways [9],[10] and also possess chromatin-remodeling capabilities owing to their histone- and transcription factor–acetylating properties\n",
      "To date, it is widely believed that in the nucleus NF-κB recruits CBP/p300 to its target promoter sites, and in this process it must compete with various other cellular transcription factors for the limiting amounts of CBP/p300 [11]. However, in recent genome-wide analyses of gene promoters/enhancers using ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq technology, p300 has emerged as a prominent marker for enhancers [12]. p300 is also pre-loaded in most of the promoters and enhancers of NF-κB-regulated genes marked with histone-H3 lysine 4 trimethyl (H3K4me3) and histone H3 lysine 4 monomethyl (H3K4me1), respectively, in unstimulated THP-1 and HeLa cells [13]. In light of these new findings, the question arises that if p300 is already preloaded on the promoter/enhancer regions of the NF-κB target genes, then what is the role of NF-κB:CBP/p300 binding in the NF-κB activated transcription\n",
      "Among the NF-κB proteins, RelA is the most potent, ubiquitously expressed and well-studied family member. It contains a TAD, which can be further divided into two regions, TA1 and TA2, as depicted in Figure 1A\n",
      "[14]. Although the activation of the NF-κB pathway is extensively studied [15], mechanistic details of the transcription initiation process by NF-κB at the promoter site are limited [16]. This can partly be attributed to the lack of any structural information and limited overall knowledge of RelA–TAD [17],[18]. The interaction of RelA with CBP/p300 represents a key step in the initiation of transcription of a subset of RelA-activated genes [19]. RelA interacts with CBP/p300 in a bipartite manner—the RHR domain of RelA contacts the KIX domain of CBP/p300 and the TAD of RelA contacts the TAZ1 (also known as the CH1) domain of CBP/p300 [20]. The former interaction requires RelA-phosphorylation at a well-conserved Ser276 residue. Although both the RHR:KIX and TAD:TAZ1 interactions contribute to transcriptional activation of RelA-dependent genes, phosphorylation of Ser276 is considered critical for the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction [20]. It remains unclear whether the interaction between the RelA–TAD and the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300 can activate transcription of RelA-target genes independent of RelA(Ser276) phosphorylation or vice versa. In addition to CBP/p300, RelA also interacts with a number of other proteins for the transcriptional activation of its target genes through its TAD, and hence a detailed knowledge of the TAD:TAZ1 binding is a necessary prelude to any mutations in the RelA–TAD, which can selectively abrogate RelA:CBP/p300 interaction [16]\n",

      "As an initial step towards elucidating the role of NF-κB:CBP/p300 interaction in transcription of NF-κB-regulated genes, we determined the solution structure of the mouse RelA–TA2 (a subdomain of TAD) in complex with the TAZ1 domain of mouse CBP. The structure reveals the high affinity binding of RelA–TA2 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites (Figure 1B) in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. The structure enabled us to design point mutants of RelA, which selectively abrogated the RelA–TAD:CBP–TAZ1 binding, thereby allowing us to gain detailed insight into the molecular determinants of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. Using these RelA mutants defective in CBP/p300 binding, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the genes influenced by the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction to confirm the differential role of the two interaction sites on the RelA regulated transcriptome. We found genes like nfkbia and ptgs2, which were previously considered independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction [19], were actually dependent on it. The dependence of nfkbia expression on RelA:CBP/p300 interaction explains how this interaction regulates the temporal profile of nuclear NF-κB (nNF-κB) following TNFα stimulation. Furthermore, we revisited the model of CBP/p300 recruitment by RelA using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Our study confirmed that CBP/p300 is preloaded on the promoter regions of our set of RelA target genes, thus indicating that RelA:CBP/p300 interaction might be vital for recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites\n",

      "Mapping of the CBP–TAZ1 Binding Site on RelA–TAD\n",
      "The RelA–TAD:CBP–TAZ1 interaction was previously mapped to RelA(477–504) region [20] (Figure 1A). We found only a weak interaction between this RelA fragment and TAZ1 as compared to the whole RelA–TAD [RelA(425–549)] and therefore scanned the entire TAD for TAZ1 binding using GST pull-down assays (Figure S1). A RelA construct spanning residues Lys425–Pro490 (in the TA2 region) emerged as the minimal fragment with maximal affinity to TAZ1. This fragment (henceforth referred to as RelA–TA2) was also optimal for structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy (Figure S1B,C). This highly acidic RelA–TA2 fragment is unstructured in its free state, as observed from the narrow dispersion of peaks in the [15N-1H]–HSQC spectrum, but exhibits a well-dispersed spectrum indicative of a folded structure when in complex with TAZ1 (Figure 1C)\n",
      "Structure of CBP–TAZ1 in the RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Complex\n",
      "The structure of the complex between RelA–TA2 (residues 425–490) and CBP–TAZ1 (residues 340–439) was determined using distance and dihedral angle restraints derived from heteronuclear NMR experiments (see Table 1 for NMR statistics). TAZ1 is a scaffolding domain that interacts with intrinsically disordered TADs of various transcription factors, which fold upon complex formation [21]–[23]. The overall structure of TAZ1 in the complex (Figure 2) resembles that of TAZ1 in its free state (RMSD 1.6 Å) and in complex with other protein targets like HIF-1α (RMSD 1.8 Å), CITED2 (1.4 Å), and STAT2 (RMSD 1.3 Å) [21],[23]–[25]. As observed in our structure, the TAZ1 fold comprises four α-helices (α1, α2, α3, and α4) arranged in a roughly tetrahedral shape and is stabilized by three zinc atoms, each of which is bound to three Cys residues and one His residue. A prominent surface feature of the TAZ1 domain is a series of interlinked hydrophobic grooves that bind intrinsically disordered TADs (Figure S2)\n",

      "Structure of RelA–TA2 in the RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Complex\n",
      "In the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 structure, the N- and C-terminal regions of the RelA–TA2 fragment used for structural analysis (Lys425–Thr433 and Ser482–Pro490, respectively) are dynamically disordered, with zero or negative [1H]-15N heteronuclear NOEs (Figure S3A), and hence are omitted from the structures shown in Figure 2A,B. Our structure shows that RelA–TA2, essentially the Leu434–Val481 region, entirely wraps around TAZ1 in a predominantly extended conformation by docking itself through its well-conserved bulky hydrophobic residues into the interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1 (Figure 2 and Figure S4A). The C-terminal region (Glu471–Asn477) of RelA–TA2 folds into one short helix αC that is anchored to the hydrophobic pocket formed by packing of α1, α2, and α3 helices of TAZ1 (Figure 2B). Likewise, the N-terminal region (Leu434–Leu439) of RelA–TA2 also forms a short helix αN, which is docked into the shallow hydrophobic groove formed at the junction of α1 and α4 of TAZ1. The αN helix is dynamically disordered with only about 30% of the helical population, as calculated from the magnitude of the C-alpha and carbonyl secondary chemical shifts [26] (Figure S3B), and the small value of the [1H]-15N heteronuclear NOE (∼0.3–0.5 for the αN residues) confirms that this region is highly flexible on the nanosecond time scale (Figure S3A). RelA–TA2 also forms two additional helical turns, Leu449–Leu452 and Leu465–Val468, which make hydrophobic contacts in the α1–α2–α3 and α1–α3 interfaces of TAZ1, respectively. The hydrophobic interactions are complemented by electrostatic interactions between the highly acidic RelA–TA2 region and the strongly electropositive surface of TAZ1. The region from Asp444–Asp448 in RelA–TA2 is particularly acidic, with four out of five residues being negatively charged, and passes through a deep cleft in the TAZ1 surface that is lined with basic residues (Lys366, Arg368, Arg369, Lys419, Lys438, Arg439) (Figure 2C). Our structural analysis was further corroborated by ITC experiments carried out at two different salt concentrations to study the electrostatic contribution of the binding event. Increasing the NaCl concentration from 50 to 150 mM weakened RelA–TA2:TAZ1 binding by 4-fold, consistent with a significant electrostatic contribution to binding from the complementary charges on TAZ1 and the RelA–TA2 region (Table 2)\n",

      "RelA–TA2 Anchors on CBP–TAZ1 Through Multiple Hydrophobic Residues\n",
      "The structure of the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex revealed that several hydrophobic residues in RelA–TA2 mediate binding within the exposed hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. The RelA–TA2 amino acid residues, which extensively interact with the hydrophobic pockets of TAZ1, belong to two ψXXψψ motifs and a ψψXXψXXψ sequence (Figure 3A), where ψ is a bulky hydrophobic residue (Leu, Val or Phe in RelA–TA2) and X can be any residue (Figure 1B). The ψXXψψ motif is a generalization of the LXXLL motifs that are known to mediate protein–protein interactions [27]. Furthermore, Val481, Phe443, and the Leu residues belonging to the αN helix of RelA–TA2 also contribute to complex formation as observed from the intermolecular NOEs (Figure S4B)\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pbio.1001647.g003Figure 3 RelA–TA2 docks itself onto a series of interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1 through a number of hydrophobic residues, which serve as anchor points\n",
      "Disruption of any of the anchor points leads to the destabilization of the whole binding architecture of the complex. ∼2,800 Å2 of RelA–TA2 surface area are buried upon formation of RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex. (A) Leu449 (left panel), Leu465 (middle panel), and Phe473 (right panel) residues of RelA–TA2 (shown as green spheres) buried into each face of the interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. Residues of TAZ1 making contacts with the above mentioned hydrophobic residues of RelA are shown as red sticks. The other hydrophobic residues of RelA–TA2—namely, Leu452, Val468, Leu476, and Leu477—making vital contacts with TAZ1 are depicted as green sticks. (B) GST-pulldown experiments performed on the RelA–TA2 mutants binding to TAZ1. RelA fragment (Lys425–Pro490) with N-terminal GST-tag was used as the wild-type protein. All the mutations were made using this construct as a template. (C) Vertical bar chart of the association constants (left vertical axis, black bars) and enthalpy change (right vertical axis, grey bars) obtained from the ITC binding isotherms of the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction corresponding to the respective RelA–TA2 wt and mutants (see Figure S5). The Leu449Ala and Leu465Ala mutants in RelA–TA2 lead to diminished association constants accompanied with decreased negative enthalpy change. The Phe473Ala mutant showed no binding (NB)\n",
      "To investigate the role of the ψXXψψ motifs, we substituted alanine for Leu449 and Phe473 of RelA, each of which represents the first ψ residue of the motif. Both Leu449 and Phe473 are deeply buried in the molecular interface and participate in extensive hydrophobic interactions (Figures 1B and 3A). We also replaced the third ψ residue of ψψXXψXXψ sequence with Ala–Leu465Ala (Figure 3A, middle panel and Figure S4A). All three RelA mutants showed diminished to completely abrogated TAZ1 binding in the GST-pulldown assays (Figure 3B) and isothermal calorimetric (ITC) experiments (Figure S5, Table 2, Figure 3C), confirming the critical role of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing the complex. The Leu449Ala and Leu465Ala substitutions each led to a 7-fold decrease in the TAZ1 binding affinity (Figure 3C and Table 2). As seen in the structure, the side chain of Leu465 is fully buried into a deep narrow hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile353, Leu357, Gln413, Ile414, His417, Trp418, Cys426, and Val428 of TAZ1 and Val468 of RelA (Figure 3A, middle panel and Figure S4A). This interaction contributes significantly to enthalpic stabilization of the complex, since the Leu465Ala substitution greatly decreases the enthalpic contribution to TAZ1 binding (Figure 3C). Leu449 binds in a shallower hydrophobic pocket, and accordingly substitution by alanine causes far less enthalpic destabilization (Figure 3A, left panel). The Phe473Ala mutation led to a complete loss of TAZ1 binding. In the structure, the side chains of Phe473, Leu476, and Leu477 (all the ψ residues of this ψXXψψ motif) are accommodated in the hydrophobic groove of TAZ1 (Figure 3A, right panel and Figure S4A). This arrangement is destabilized in the Phe473Ala mutant, leading to complete loss of TAZ1 binding. We speculate that a similar effect would be observed for Leu476Ala and Leu477Ala mutants\n",
      "Apart from the above-mentioned residues of RelA–TA2, the contacts between TAZ1 and the disordered αN helix of RelA–TA2 contribute slightly to formation of the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex (Figure S4B). N-terminal truncation to remove residues Lys425–His440, thereby eliminating the entire αN helix, decreases the affinity by only 1.6-fold (Figure 3C and Table 2). Likewise, deletion of residues Ser486–Pro490 from the disordered C-terminal end of RelA had no effect on TAZ1 binding (Figure S1D). However, further truncation to remove Val481–His485 greatly impaired binding by eliminating hydrophobic contacts between Val481 of RelA(TA2) and the side chains of Leu359, Leu381, and Pro382 in TAZ1. Replacement of Met483 by alanine had no effect on binding (Figure 3B), confirming that RelA residues beyond Val481 do not contribute to the interaction\n",
      "In summary, our structure shows that RelA–TA2 spirals through the exposed hydrophobic pockets of TAZ1 and anchors itself on TAZ1 at a number of points. As observed from the mutation studies, disruption of any of these anchoring residues of RelA–TA2 leads to the destabilization of the entire binding architecture of the entire complex\n",
      "Possible Role of Phosphorylation in RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Binding\n",
      "The RelA–TA2 region also contains a well-conserved Ser467 (Ser468 in human RelA), which is a known phosphorylation site. Depending upon the stimulus, this site can be phosphorylated by GSK3β, IKKε, or IKKβ and plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation of NF-κB dependent genes [28]–[31]. Ser467 resides in the ψψXXψXXψ sequence of RelA–TA2 (Figure 1B), and in the complex it is close to the cluster of basic residues at the N-terminus of helix α1 of TAZ1. Our ITC experiments show that a phosphomimetic mutant, RelA(Ser467Asp), binds TAZ1 with about 1.4-fold higher affinity than wild type RelA–TA2 and exhibits the same dependence on ionic strength, suggesting an enhanced but still nonspecific electrostatic interaction (Table 2 and Figure 3C). Thus, the increased negative charge of phosphoserine would likely enhance TAZ1 binding even further over nonphosphorylated RelA\n",
      "Comparative Binding Analysis of RelA–RHR:CBP–KIX and RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 Interactions\n",
      "In addition to the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction, the RelA–RHR interacts with CBP–KIX via p-Ser276–RelA [20]. We compared the binding of RHR to KIX and TA2 to TAZ1 by GST-pulldown assay using nuclear extracts (NEs) of wild-type 3T3 cells stimulated with TNFα for 30 min. KIX and TAZ1 were purified as GST-fusion proteins and used to pull down nuclear-RelA (nRelA). As seen in Figure 4A, significantly lower amounts of nRelA were pulled down by GST–KIX compared to GST–TAZ1, which can be due to either of the two possibilities or both: first, a lower binding affinity of RelA–RHR:KIX compared to RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex, and second, presence of only a small fraction of p-Ser276–RelA in the total pool of nRelA. In this context, we compared the binding affinities reported in the literature for KIX with other target proteins [32],[33] and found the reported binding affinities for KIX complexes typically 10–100-fold lower than those observed for various TAZ1 complexes [32],[33]\n",

Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed with α-CBP and α-p300 on NE in exactly the same manner as for the IP experiments above. The recruitment of nRelA by CBP/p300 is similar at 15 min relative to 30 min but diminishes at 45 min after TNFα stimulation despite the concentration of total RelA in the nucleus being significantly lower at 15 min after stimulation. Identical co-IP experiments with the RelA(Ser467Ala) mutant shows a direct proportionality in CBP/p300 binding with the concentrations of total nRelA at the different time points after stimulation. This indicates that the exclusively nuclear p-Ser467–RelA whose concentration peaks at about 10 to 15 min post-TNFα stimulation possesses a higher binding affinity for CBP/p300 compared to the nonphosphorylated form\n",
      "Overall, in either possible scenarios the total amount of RelA–TA2 bound to TAZ1 is significantly higher than that of RelA–RHR bound KIX, which should be reflected in a subset of RelA-activated genes that is regulated through RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction and is independent of p-Ser276–RelA:KIX binding\n",

      "Next, we studied the role of the critical hydrophobic residues of RelA–TA2 (Leu449, Leu465, and Phe473) on TAZ1 binding in the context of full-length RelA. We used in vitro purified GST-tagged TAZ1 to pull down full-length wild-type (wt) or mutant RelA (Figure 4B) from the NEs of TNFα treated rela\n",
      "−/− cells (see Materials and Methods) reconstituted with RelA(wt/mutants). We found that the RelA mutants, namely RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala) and RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala+Ser467Ala), were completely defective in binding to TAZ1 (Figure 4B). As expected, the Ser276Ala mutation had no effect on TAZ1 binding. Interestingly, the RelA(Leu449Ala) mutant did not show any noticeable decrease in binding affinity, contrary to the impaired TAZ1 binding observed in our in vitro GST pulldown and ITC experiments. A possible explanation is that in vivo posttranslational modifications like the phosphorylation of the well-conserved Ser467 could potentially mitigate the effects of the Leu449 mutation, thus increasing binding affinity of the RelA–TA2 to TAZ1, as observed by ITC experiments (Figure 3C and Table 2). Additionally, in the context of full-length RelA, the other domains of RelA could further influence the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 binding\n",
      "The above experiments established the minimal subset of mutations required in RelA to selectively prevent its interaction with the TAZ1 domain of CBP. These RelA mutants along with the RelA(Ser276Ala) were further tested for their interaction with endogenous CBP by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP). Binding of all three RelA mutants [RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala), RelA(Leu449Ala+Ser467Ala+Phe473Ala), and RelA(Ser276Ala)] to endogenous CBP was impaired relative to RelA(wt) (Figure 4C). However, the disruption of either component of the RelA:CBP interaction—RHR:KIX or TA2:TAZ1—diminished but could not completely abrogate the entire RelA:CBP interaction. The RelA(Leu449Ala+Phe473Ala) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants were equally defective in binding to p300 (Figure 4D), whose TAZ1 domains share high sequence identity with CBP [22]\n",
      "Role of RelA(Ser467) Phosphorylation in RelA:CBP/p300 Interaction\n",
      "To further elucidate the role of Ser467 in RelA:CBP/p300 binding, we first studied the RelA(Ser467) phosphorylation event both spatially and temporally following TNFα stimulation. As shown in Figure S6A, the amount of p-Ser467–RelA is negligible in the unstimulated cells. Phosphorylation increases within 5 min of TNFα stimulation, reaching its maximum at 10 to 15 min followed by gradual dephosphorylation starting at 20 min after stimulation. We confirmed the presence of p-Ser467–RelA exclusively in the nucleus [34] (Figure 4E). The timing of RelA nuclear entry coincides with the p-Ser467–RelA maximum, indicating a possible correlation between the Ser467 phosphorylation event and an enhanced early RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. This correlation holds true only if Ser467 phosphorylation contributes towards increasing the affinity. To confirm this, co-IP experiments with α-CBP and α-p300 using NEs of RelA(wt) and RelA(Ser467Ala) mutants at three different time points after TNFα stimulation (Figure 4E) in addition to unstimulated condition were performed. Interestingly, in the RelA(wt) reconstituted cells, despite lower amounts of nRelA at 15 min than at 30 min of TNFα treatment, equivalent amounts of RelA co-immunoprecipitated with CBP/p300. The amount of nRelA bound to CBP/p300 at 45 min after TNFα stimulation diminished significantly. The nonlinearity of the amounts of nRelA co-immunoprecipitated with CBP/p300 with respect to the nRelA concentration is attributed to the enhanced binding affinity of p-Ser467–RelA for CBP/p300, as this nonlinearity was not observed for the identical experiment performed using RelA(Ser467Ala) mutant reconstituted rela\n",

Second, RelA(Ser467) is a key determining factor for various other processes in the NF-κB pathway [28],[35],[36], which could further complicate and lead to misinterpretation of our experimental observations.

The lower levels of nfkbia mRNA in the RelA(Ser276Ala) reconstituted cell line following TNFα stimulation as compared to those observed for RelA(wt) reconstituted cells could possibly be due to the lower expression of RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant in the cell relative to RelA(wt) and RelA(TA2) mutant (Figure S7)\n",
      "Comparative Genome-Wide Expression Analysis Reveals That a Major Set of RelA Target Genes Is Regulated by the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 Interaction\n",
      "To ascertain the effect of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction on the RelA-regulated transcriptome, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of total mRNA isolated from RelA(wt/mutants) reconstituted cells prior to TNFα stimulation as well as at two different times points after TNFα stimulation (Figure 5B). The set of genes activated upon TNFα stimulation was classified into four groups: Group A contains genes that are dependent on both the interaction components of the RelA:CBP/p300 complex. Group B contains those dependent only on the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction. Group C contains genes that are dependent only on p-Ser276–RelA, and Group D contains TNFα activated genes, which are RelA regulated but are altogether independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction, or the genes that are activated by transcription factors other than RelA. The RNA-seq data revealed that a majority of the RelA:CBP/p300 target genes belong to Group B (25 genes) followed by Group A (20 genes) and Group C (six genes). A sizable number of RelA target genes belong to RelA:CBP/p300 independent Group D (48 genes) (Figure 5B). Based on these experiments, it is clear that the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction regulates a subset of RelA target genes independent of p-Ser276–RelA. Thus, the subset of RelA-activated genes dependent on RelA:CBP/p300 interaction is much larger than previously believed\n",

IκBα is a strong negative regulator of nuclear NF-κB (nNF-κB) and hence a key determinant of the nNF-κB temporal profile [39]. The canonical NF-κB pathway stimulated by TNFα has been extensively studied and focuses on the activation of the IKK-IκB-NF-κB signaling module. A mathematical model, which accounts for experimentally observed nNF-κB activity and IκB expression profiles, has been established [40],[41].

      "−/− cells reconstituted with wild-type or mutant RelA. To detect nNF-κB in NEs, the NF-κB DNA binding activity was measured by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) (Figure 6C). nRelA levels were also monitored directly by immunoblotting (Figure S8). The time of entry of RelA(TA2) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants into the nucleus after TNFα stimulation is identical to that observed for RelA(wt). However, a prolonged nuclear residence time is observed for RelA(TA2) mutant relative to RelA(wt) reconstituted cells (Figure 6C and Figure S8). We also performed similar time course experiments using the whole cell extracts (WEs) of the respective cells and monitored the IκBα protein levels by immunoblot (Figure 6D). While the time of IκBα degradation and RelA entry into the nucleus are identical in the RelA(wt), RelA(Ser276Ala) and RelA(TA2) mutant reconstituted rela\n",
      "−/− cells (Figure 6C,D), the temporal profile of IκBα regeneration and the nuclear residence time of RelA differed significantly (Figure 6C–E). For the RelA(TA2) mutant reconstituted cells, IκBα regeneration is delayed and does not reach its initial levels within the time course of the experiment. The RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant on the other hand did not show any significant delay in IκBα regeneration, although the IκBα level was reduced\n",
      "In order to address our observed results, we applied the available mathematical model of NF-κB regulation [40],[41]. We assumed that all parameters other than the RelA protein abundance and its transcriptional activation potential remained unchanged in all of the RelA reconstituted rela\n",
      "−/− cell lines. Identical IκBα degradation and nuclear translocation of RelA for the three cell lines validated our assumption (through 30 min after TNFα stimulation in Figure 6C,D and Figure S8). Further, when the cell-line-specific RelA concentration estimates were incorporated into the model, the calculated profile for nNF-κB activity and IκBα abundance matched the experimental data of the RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant to a significant extent (Figure 6E, lowest panel), but did not resemble the observed profiles for the RelA(TA2) mutant (Figure 6E, middle panel). The root mean square deviation (RMSD) was used as a measure of agreement between calculated and the observed data. The results suggest that the observed partial expression of nfkbia in RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant reconstituted cells in our qRT-PCR data (Figure 5) was to a great extent due to lower expression of this RelA mutant in the cell line used here\n",
      "For the RelA(TA2) mutant, we investigated whether agreement between the experimentally observed and calculated data could be obtained by reducing the NF-κB-dependent IκBα mRNA production rate (kmRNA) parameter to 25%, 12.5%, or 6.25% of its value for RelA(wt) (Figure 6F). We found that the lowest kmRNA of 6.25% of RelA(wt) produced the best superimposition of the calculated and experimentally determined temporal profiles of the nNF-κB activity and IκBα regeneration as determined by the RMSD score (Figure 6F, top panel). It should be noted that the kmRNA is directly proportional to the transcriptional activation potential of nNF-κB. Our study suggests that the Leu449Ala and Phe473Ala mutations in RelA lower the transcriptional activation of NF-κB by impairing the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction\n",
      "From the above results we conclude that while nfkbia is dependent on RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction, it is independent of RelA–RHR:KIX interaction. Thus, our data show that disrupting the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 component of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction disturbs the temporal profile of the nuclear activity of RelA by interfering with the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway. This could further deregulate the expression of the subset of NF-κB-dependent genes, which are independent of the overall RelA:CBP/p300 interaction\n",
      "RelA:CBP/p300 Interaction at the RelA Target Promoters\n",
      "To further understand the nature of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction on the chromatin, ChIP-qPCR assay was performed to analyze the chromatin at six RelA target genes in unstimulated and TNFα-stimulated RelA(wt/mutants) reconstituted rela\n",
      "−/− cells. We examined the chromatin for RelA occupancy on its target promoter set (Figures 7A and S9). As expected, we found that RelA(wt) was recruited to the promoters of all the six genes (although to a varied extent) at 30 min after TNFα treatment. This enrichment of RelA(wt) was diminished at 60 min after stimulation in congruence with its nuclear exit. The recruitment of RelA(TA2) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants to the promoter sites of highly expressed tnfaip3, nfkbia, and ptgs2 was significantly reduced at 30 min following TNFα treatment compared to RelA(wt), while for the mutants there was no significant RelA signal detected on the promoters with low mRNA expression levels (cxcl2, csf2, and tnf). In agreement with the prolonged nuclear retention of RelA(TA2) mutant due to a defective negative feedback loop, reduced amounts of the RelA(TA2) mutant remained bound to the tnfaip3, nfkbia, and ptgs2 promoters even at 60 min after stimulation. As indicated earlier, expression of tnfaip3 and nfkbia were reduced but not completely eliminated. Therefore, the mRNA levels of the RelA target genes correlate well with the amounts of RelA recruited to their respective promoters. These results clearly indicate defects in promoter recruitment of RelA mutants despite their uncompromised DNA binding potential (Figure 6C). This led us to hypothesize that CBP/p300 might be responsible for recruitment of RelA to its target gene promoters. If our hypothesis were true, then CBP/p300 should be constitutively loaded on the promoters and there should exist a direct correlation between the amounts of CBP/p300 present on the promoters to that of RelA recruited upon stimulation. To test our hypothesis, the chromatins were analyzed for CBP/p300 enrichment for our promoter set. The results show CBP/p300 enriched on all of the promoters to a varied extent, with no significant change upon TNFα stimulation (Figures 7B and S9). A comparison of CBP/p300 and RelA signals in this assay revealed a direct correlation between enrichment of RelA upon stimulation with that of CBP/p300 (Figure 7C). Similar RelA recruitment was observed for RelA(wt), RelA(TA2), and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants on RelA target promoters independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction (Figure S10)\n",

      "−/− cells for six RelA target genes\n",
      "Since acetylation of histone-3 (H3) at Lys27 by CBP/p300 is a characteristic of active genes [44], we further examined the levels of H3 occupancy and compared them with that of acetylated histone H3 at Lys 27 (H3K27ac). We expected to observe increased H3K27ac signals on the promoters only after TNFα treatment as a mark of activated promoters as compared to those in unstimulated cells. To our surprise we found H3K27ac enriched in the unstimulated promoters, whose levels remained constant even after TNFα stimulation. Additionally, the H3K27ac levels were directly proportional to the amount of CBP/p300 present on the specific promoters (Figure 7C). This suggests that CBP/p300 bound to promoters of RelA targets is poised for transcription initiation. Upon nuclear entry RelA is recruited to its respective promoter targets by CBP/p300, which is preloaded on these sites, leading to transcription activation\n",
      "Upon TNFα stimulation in RelA(TA2) or RelA(Ser276Ala) mutant reconstituted rela\n",
      "−/− cells, the mRNA expression levels of the highly expressed genes like tnfaip3 and nfkbia registered only partial reduction (Figure 5A). This is because of a reduced but significant amount of RelA recruited to their respective promoters (Figure 7A). Both the promoters also maintain high levels of CBP/p300, thereby leading to recruitment of the RelA(TA2) and RelA(Ser276Ala) mutants, which possess reduced but significant CBP/p300 binding affinity (Figure 4C,D). This further proves that the RelA-dependent gene expression is regulated by the total amount of RelA recruited on the promoter by CBP/p300\n",
      "Overall our study indirectly shows that CBP/p300, which marks the promoter/enhancers of genes, also aids in recruiting RelA to the promoters of its target genes\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "In this study, we have provided the structural basis and the functional role of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction in RelA-driven transcription. In the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 structure, the RelA–TA2 region binds within a series of interlinked hydrophobic grooves that spiral almost entirely around the globular TAZ1 domain. Due to the intrinsically disordered nature of the RelA–TA2 region, binding of an elongated ∼50 amino acid region to TAZ1 in a relatively extended configuration can be accomplished without the energetic cost that would be incurred if unfolding of preexisting globular structure was required. The interaction is mediated primarily by hydrophobic residues interspersed with acidic residues located in the RelA–TA2 region, which dock in the hydrophobic pockets in the surface of TAZ1. While RelA becomes more ordered upon interaction with TAZ1, only limited, highly localized secondary structure is formed. Contacts between the N-terminal part of the RelA–TA2 and TAZ1 are dynamic, contributing little to binding affinity, and are an example of what is frequently termed a “fuzzy” interaction [45]. The hydrophobic contacts are complemented by electrostatic interactions involving the many acidic residues in the RelA–TA2 region. Disruption of any of the hydrophobic contacts leads to a significant decrease in binding affinity toward TAZ1. This is due to the destabilization of the ordered RelA–TA2 structure held primarily by the exposed hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. Upon disruption of any of the anchor points, RelA–TA2 in absence of any highly stabilized secondary structural elements regains its highly dynamic unstructured high-energy state. This leads to destabilization of the complex and a decrease in TAZ1 binding affinity. Disruption of the hydrophobic anchors of RelA–TA2 can also destabilize the hydrophobic core of TAZ1, which is otherwise stabilized to a significant extent on complex formation with RelA–TA2 (Figure S11). This interlinked core of TAZ1 holds the entire RelA–TA2 region in the complex as seen through the contacts of the core elements with the anchoring residues of RelA–TA2\n",
      "The mode of binding of the TAZ1 domain to RelA–TA2 is closely analogous to its interactions with the transactivation domains of the HIF-1α, CITED2, and STAT2 proteins [21]–[24],[46]. In particular, RelA binds in the same hydrophobic grooves as the HIF-1α C-terminal activation domain but in the reverse orientation [21], despite the fact that the two proteins share no common sequence motifs and do not interact with TAZ1 through common secondary structures. A salient property of TAZ1 is its ability to interact with long, negatively charged 40–50 residue regions of intrinsically disordered proteins that dock in the narrow hydrophobic grooves in its surface. This interaction is further enhanced by the phosphorylation of Ser467, thereby adding another layer of regulation for a subset of early response target genes of RelA following TNFα stimulation. Similar phosphorylation events are observed in other transcription factors, which influence their interaction with CBP/p300 [47],[48]\n",
      "To date, inducible phosphorylation of Ser276 is considered to be the decisive factor for the recruitment of CBP/p300 by RelA for the transcriptional activation of RelA-dependent genes [19],[20]. Earlier studies have shown that in the absence of Ser276 phosphorylation, histone deacetylases (HDACs) could remain bound to nNF-κB and lead to the repression of NF-κB-dependent genes [19],[49]. Upon phosphorylation at Ser276, RelA readily recruits CBP/p300, which in turn acetylates RelA at Lys310, which is further required for the transcription of a subset of RelA-dependent genes [50],[51]. Our experiments show that a major subset of TNFα-inducible genes is dependent on the RelA–TA2:TAZ1 interaction. Importantly, a significant number of these genes (Figure 5B, Group B genes) are activated independently of Ser276 phosphorylation. For these genes the requirement of p-Ser276–RelA could be compensated by a synergy between multiple protein factors (including transcription factors) and RelA. A similar mechanism was previously observed for cxcl2 and nfkbia transcription, where the requirement for RelA:TRAP-80 interaction was waived for the expression of these genes through the recruitment of secondary transcription factors [16]. Similarly, for tnfaip3 transcription, the constitutive transcription factor Sp1 plays an important role in synergy with RelA [52]. Moreover, the location of Ser276 in the DD of RelA could potentially influence the selectivity of its dimer formation with other NF-κB family members [53]. Additionally, the proximity of Ser276 to DNA binding residues of RelA could further impact the κB site selectivity [54], thereby leading to differential gene expression and/or compensating for the RelA–RHR:KIX interaction\n",
      "In this study, for the first time we show that the negative feedback loop is directly controlled by RelA:CBP/p300 interaction through the expression of nfkbia. Similarly, A20 protein (tnfaip3 gene product), another regulator of the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway, is also directly controlled by RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. The impaired negative feedback loop can impact the expression profile of TNFα-induced genes. The longer residence time of RelA in the nucleus can prolong the activation of the genes that are independent of RelA:CBP/p300 interaction\n",
      "RelA is believed to recruit co-activator CBP/p300 to the gene promoters for transcription activation of its target genes. On the other hand, recent ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip studies have established p300 as a mark for the enhancers/promoters of active/poised genes throughout the genome including those for RelA target genes [12],[13]. However, the mechanism of its recruitment by RelA to the promoters remains to be established. In this study, we found that CBP/p300 was constitutively enriched on the RelA target promoters as against the TNFα-induced recruitment of RelA to these sites. This points towards a role played by CBP/p300 in recruitment of RelA to its target promoters. Although we have tested only a small set of RelA target promoters, our observation is consistent with the report by Jin et al. [13], where they could accurately predict the target selection by NF-κB in a cell-type-specific manner only when experimentally determined p300 enrichment of promoters was considered along with κB motif [55],[56] along the human genome\n",

The fragments were purified under denaturing conditions on a Ni-NTA (SIGMA) column followed by dialysis against cleavage buffer [20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl] at 4°C. The His6–GB1 peptide was cleaved by thrombin at room temperature for 18 h. The cleaved RelA peptides were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC (RPHPLC) using a C18 column on ÄKTA purifier system. The purified peptides were lyophilized immediately. For NMR and ITC experiments, the TAZ1 domain (residues 340–439 of mouse CBP) was expressed and refolded as described previously [24].

The GB1-tag was used for accurate concentration determination of the RelA–TA2 peptides, which have a low extinction coefficient. The GB1-tag did not interact with TAZ1. A typical ITC experiment consisted of a total of 25 injections, using 5–6 µl of TAZ1 for the first injection followed by 24 injections of 11–12 µl of TAZ1 into the cell containing either blank or RelA peptide.

We added 5% D2O to the sample prior to NMR experiments. NMR data were processed using NMRPipe [59] and analyzed using CARA [60]. Backbone and side-chain resonances were assigned using standard triple resonance experiments [61]. Distance restraints were obtained from 3D 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm = 100 ms) and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm = 100 ms) spectra. Intermolecular NOEs were derived from 12C-filtered-13C-edited NOESY-HSQC (τm = 200 ms) [62] experiments. Unambiguous intermolecular NOES were assigned manually and were used in the initial structure calculations, which were performed using CYANA [63] with CANDID [64]. Chemical shift-based torsion angles were obtained using TALOS+ [65]. Distance and torsion angle restraints were imposed to ensure tetrahedral geometry for the zinc atoms of TAZ1 [25].

      "Optimization of RelA–TAD fragment in RelA–TAD:TAZ1 complex for structural analysis. (A) Schematic of GST-tagged RelA–TAD constructs. All constructs were overexpressed and purified for the GST-pulldown assays. Construct T11 (marked with an asterisk) was determined to be the optimal fragment for CBP–TAZ1 binding. (B) GST-pulldown experiment for optimization of the N-terminal end of the RelA fragment binding to TAZ1. (C) GST-pulldown experiment for optimization of the C-terminal end of the RelA fragment binding to TAZ1. (D) GST-pulldown experiment for studying the importance of the five amino acids at the C-terminal end of the RelA fragment binding to TAZ1. (E) Gel filtration elution profile of CBP–TAZ1 domain, RelA–TA2 fragment, and RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 complex. The RelA–TA2 fragment was detected at 215 nm due to lack of tyrosine and tryptophan residues. RelA–TA2:TAZ1 complex and free TAZ1 were detected at 280 nm. A slight excess of TAZ1 was used for the complex formation as can be seen in the elution profile of the complex. (F) Gel filtration elution characteristics of CBP–TAZ1 domain, RelA–TA2 fragment, and RelA–TA2:CBP–TAZ1 complex. The observed molecular weight of RelA–TA2 fragment is about 3 times that of its calculated molecular weight, which further confirms the unstructured nature of RelA–TA2 concluded from its [15N-1H]-HSQC spectra in Figure 1C. Zn2+-bound well-folded TAZ1 elution profile corresponds to that of a lower calculated molecular weight protein\n",

The secondary structural elements are represented schematically above the corresponding plots. Higher values of NOEs correspond to more rigid structure. (B) Chemical shift deviation (CSD) of Cα (top panel) and C′ (bottom panel) for RelA–TA2 in the complex from that of their sequence-corrected random coil chemical shifts. The percentage of the helix population for the RelA–TA2 region in the complex was estimated from the CSDs of Cα and C′ chemical shifts averaged from Leu434–Leu439 for the αN and from Ser471–Leu477 for the αC helix. The secondary chemical shift for a fully formed α-helix is 2.8 ppm and 2.1 ppm for Cα and C′, respectively [26]. The estimated helical population from the average CSD for the αN and αC terminal helix of RelA–TA2 is 32% and 84%, respectively\n",

      "Though most of the transcripts are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), little is known about their functions. lncRNAs usually function through interactions with proteins, which implies the importance of identifying the binding proteins of lncRNAs in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of lncRNAs. Only a few approaches are available for predicting interactions between lncRNAs and proteins. In this study, we introduce a new method lncPro\n",
      "Results\n",
      "By encoding RNA and protein sequences into numeric vectors, we used matrix multiplication to score each RNA–protein pair. This score can be used to measure the interactions between an RNA–protein pair. This method effectively discriminates interacting and non-interacting RNA–protein pairs and predicts RNA–protein interactions within a given complex. Applying this method on all human proteins, we found that the long non-coding RNAs we collected tend to interact with nuclear proteins and RNA-binding proteins\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "Compared with the existing approaches, our method shortens the time for training matrix and obtains optimal results based on the model being used. The ability of predicting the associations between lncRNAs and proteins has also been enhanced. Our method provides an idea on how to integrate different information into the prediction process\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Recent studies show that only a small part of the human transcriptome is involved in the protein-coding process [1]. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise the majority of transcripts; however, little is known about the function of lncRNAs [2]. The GENCODE project discovered more than 14,000 lncRNA transcripts from approximately 9,000 gene loci [3]. The lncRNA database collected a few hundred of high-confidence, experimentally validated lncRNAs [4]. For example, the Xist RNA of humans is a large RNA sequence (19 kb) that has remained untranslated [5]. Xist RNA has been proven to have an important function in regulating X-inactivation [6,7]. Although an increasing list of evidence demonstrates that lncRNAs may be involved in multiple biological processes, including epigenetic regulation, chromatin remodeling, and cell proliferation and differentiation, the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of lncRNAs still remain largely elusive\n",
      "In general, lncRNAs function with their binding proteins. Thus, in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of lncRNAs, the binding proteins of lncRNAs need to be identified. Several experimental approaches such as RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis have been developed to identify the lncRNA binding proteins. Recently, Bellucci et al. [8] developed a computational method CatRAPID for predicting RNA–protein interactions. They further used the method on the predictions of protein interactions in the Xist network [9]. The method involves encoding protein-RNA pairs into feature vectors, identifying a matrix, and calculating the interaction score through matrix computation. Their results showed that the method is powerful and may be used to predict RNA–protein interactions from sequences\n",
      "This study aims to explore a new method, lncPro, for predicting lncRNA–protein interactions. lncPro yields a score using amino acid and nucleotide sequences. This score can be used to measure the interaction between a pair of lncRNA and protein. Fisher’s linear discriminant method was used to compute the matrix directly. Based on the mathematical model being used, the result was found to be theoretically optimal in the sense of discriminant. Applying lncPro on all human proteins, we found that the long non-coding RNAs we collected tend to interact with nuclear proteins and RNA-binding proteins. A convenient online server (http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncpro) has been developed for lncPro\n",

      "A training set containing many pairs of proteins and RNAs is needed. Information on the interactivity of each pair is also required\n",
      "Complexes were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (http://www.pdb.org). RNA–protein pairs were extracted from these complexes. Although the number of pairs is large, many sequences from the same complex are identical according to PDB. These repeated pairs were deleted. Take complex 2FTC as an example. 2FTC has 18 chains, but chain E and chain F are identical. Thus, we included 17 chains (one RNA sequence and 16 protein sequences) in the training set. Following this procedure, a training set containing 1761 pairs was obtained from 44 complexes (Additional file 1: Table S1). Among the RNAs in the training set, some sequences are noticeably shorter than the long non-coding RNAs (more than 200 bp) we wish to study. When deleting all the sequences shorter than 200 bp, this led to a small training set, therefore sequences longer than 100 bp were kept in the training set. This selection was an approximation and not all the RNA sequences contained in our training set are long non-coding RNAs. Following the procedure above, a training set containing 726 pairs was obtained. These remaining pairs came from 18 complexes (Additional file 2: Table S2). The corresponding complexes and organisms are listed in Table 1\n",

      "After collecting RNA–protein pairs, a criterion is needed to determine whether a pair is interactive or non-interactive. The “least atom distance” was used as the criterion [10]: assume that R is an RNA molecule and P is a protein molecule. If there exists an atom r of R and an atom p of P such that the distance between r and p is less than 5 Å, the pair (R and P) is considered to be interactive. Otherwise, the pair is non-interactive. The distance cutoff 5 Å was borrowed from the PRIDB database [10]. RNA–protein pairs in the training set can now be classified based on interactivity. Each pair in the training set was checked, yielding 355 interactive pairs and 371 non-interactive pairs. Since some sequences in this dataset are similar, this set will be called the redundant training set in the following sections. If these highly similar sequences were assigned to the training set and test set respectively, the evaluation of the performance would be biased. The CD-HIT tool (http://weizhong-lab.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin) was used to compute sequence similarity for both protein and RNA sequences. Pairs that share both the protein sequence and the RNA sequence are considered to be similar, and thus removed from the training set. The similarity cutoff was set at 90% for both protein and RNA. After redundancy removal, a training set containing 649 protein-RNA pairs, including 322 interactive pairs and 327 non-interactive pairs, was obtained. This set will be called the non-redundant training set\n",
      "Feature vector encoding\n",
      "This section will focus on encoding sequences into numerical feature vectors. Information from the secondary structure, the hydrogen-bonding propensities, and the Van der Waals’ propensities was used. The encoding procedure is presented in Figure 1. Details for each vector are described below\n",
      "Figure 1 Procedure of encoding the RNA sequences and the amino acid sequences into feature vectors. a) Procedure of encoding the RNA sequences into feature vectors. For the secondary structure, RNAsubopt was used to obtain the top six possible secondary structures with the lowest free energy. The dots and brackets were then replaced by 0 s and 1 s, respectively. The six vectors were added, and the secondary structure feature vector was obtained. For Van der Waal’s interaction and hydrogen bonding, each base was replaced by numbers representing the propensities. Finally, all three feature vectors were transformed by the Fourier series, and the first 10 terms of Fourier series were used as the new feature vector. b) Procedure of encoding the amino acid sequences into feature vectors. For the feature vector of the secondary structure, the corresponding Chou-Fasman propensities were used to encode each amino acid according to the secondary structure predicted by Predator. For the feature vectors of hydrogen bonding, each amino acid was replaced by Grantham’s and Zimmerman’s scores, respectively. Kyte-Doolittle and Bull-Breese scores were used for Van der Waals’ interaction, respectively. For all five feature vectors, the first 10 terms of the Fourier series were used as new feature vectors\n",
      "Secondary structure propensities\n",
      "RNAsubopt from the Vienna Package [11] was used to predict the secondary structure of RNAs. RNAsubopt provides n possible forms of secondary structure with the lowest free energy. Different selections of n may lead to differences in performance. The Discriminative Power (Details of discriminative power can be found in the “Measuring the performance of the method” section) is used as an indicator of the performance. The Discriminative Power does not change significantly when n is set at values of 5, 6, 7, or 8 (4-fold cross validation gave discriminative power values of 90.5, 90.3, 91.2, and 91.6, respectively). Since a larger n value brings more computation, n was set at six. When an RNA sequence was given, six results were obtained in the form of dots and brackets. Each bracket was replaced with “1”, and each dot was replaced with “0”. Thereafter, six binary sequences were added to obtain a new feature vector with integers between zero and six\n",
      "Predator [12] software was used to predict the secondary structure of proteins. Chou-Fasman propensities were used to encode each amino acid [13]. By replacing each amino acid in the sequence with the corresponding Chou-Fasman propensity, the sequence was transformed into a numerical feature vector\n",
      "Hydrogen-bonding propensities and Van der Waals’ propensities\n",
      "Purine and pyrimidine contact information from a set of 41 RNA–protein complexes [14] was used to encode the RNA numerical feature vectors for hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals’ interaction. The RNA feature vectors showed the propensities of the atoms to form hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals’ interaction. The performance evaluation may be biased if the set of 41 RNA–protein complexes for purine and pyrimidine contact information have significant overlaps with our training set. Among these 41 complexes, only one complex (1JJ2) is shared with our training set and 12 RNA-protein pairs are involved. We further used the CD-HIT tool to check whether there are significant similarities for the other sequences. When the cutoff was set at 0.9 for both RNA and protein, only three RNA-protein pairs are shared between our training set and those 41 complexes. Therefore, these 41 RNA–protein complexes for purine and pyrimidine contact information do not have significant overlap with the training set\n",
      "For the proteins, hydrogen bonding feature vectors were encoded using Grantham’s propensities [15] and Zimmerman’s propensities [16]. Feature vectors of Van der Waals’ interaction were encoded using Kyte-Doolittle [17] and Bull-Breese propensities [18]. Together with the secondary structure feature vector, each protein sequence was encoded into five numerical feature vectors\n",
      "Transformation of the dimension\n",
      "Each protein sequence and each RNA sequence were transformed into five and three numerical feature vectors, respectively. However, these vectors cannot be used for direct computations because the dimension of each vector depends on the length of the corresponding RNA or protein sequence, which makes it impossible to find a fixed matrix M to conduct the computation. Therefore, the vectors need to be transformed in order to unify the dimension\n",
      "The Fourier series was used to solve the problem. The formula is presented as follows:\n",
      " (1) Xk'=2L∑n=0LXncosπLn+12k+12,k=0,1,…,9 \n",
      "Where L is the length of the original feature vector\n",
      "Here, the first 10 terms of the Fourier series were used as the new numerical feature vector. Dimension 10 was selected because the results did not improve significantly with a higher dimension and the computation is faster when the dimension is set lower. When the dimension was set at 10, 15, and 20, we acquired Discriminative Power (Details of discriminative power can be found in the “Measuring the performance of the method” section) values 90.3%, 89.8%, and 91.9% respectively. After transforming each RNA–protein pair into eight 10-dimensional numerical feature vectors (three for RNA and five for protein), the feature vector encoding process was completed\n",
      "Finding the matrix\n",
      "For each pair of feature vectors r and p (representing the RNA feature vector and the protein feature vector, respectively), we want to train a matrix M and use the score <p|M|r > to measure the interaction between r and p. M will be a 100-D matrix because the dimension of vectors was set at 10. If we unsystematically search the matrix in the 100-D Euclidean space, the efficiency and accuracy would be low. The efficiency and accuracy will be further degraded when a higher dimension is used\n",
      "Let us analyze the expansion of <p|M|r>. Without loss of generality, the situation of dimension two is used to clarify the idea:\n",
      "Assuming that p = (p1, p2), r = (r1, r2)T,\n",
      "M=M1M2M3M4, then\n",
      " (2) <p|M|r>=p1p2M1M2M3M4r1r2=p1M1r1+p1M2r2+p2M3r1+p2M4r2 \n",
      "Equivalently, we can write <p|M|r > as follows:\n",
      " (3) <p|M|r>=M1p1r1+M2p1r2+M3p2r1+M4p2r2=kx \n",
      "Here, k = (M1, M2, M3, M4), x = (p1r1, p1r2, p2r1, p2r2)T\n",
      "When given p and r, then x will be fixed. Therefore, the idea of finding the matrix M is equivalent to finding the vector k. The score <p|M|r > is actually the inner product of vectors x and k. This inner product score is expected to discriminate the data into two groups. Thus, according to the theory of Fisher’s linear discriminant method, the best vector k is actually the direction k to optimize the Fisher criterion function:\n",
      " (4) Jk=m1‒m22s12+s22 \n",
      "Here, mi represents the mean of each category. si2=∑x∈Cix‒mi2. The subscript denotes two different classes\n",
      "In the ten-dimensional case, the whole procedure is similar. We can obtain the following:\n",
      " (5) <p|M|r>=kx \n",
      "Where k = (M1, M2, …, M100) and x = (p1r1, p1r2, …, p10r10)T; both are 100-dimensional vectors. After transforming each pair of r and p in the training set into (p1r1, p1r2, …, p10r10)T, Fisher’s linear discriminant method was applied to these 100-dimensional vectors. Subsequently, the optimal direction k was computed directly\n",
      "Thus, the problem of finding a matrix M in the 100-dimensional Euclidean space was transformed into another equivalent problem of finding a vector k. Using Fisher’s linear discriminant method, k was computed directly from known data, thereby simplifying the process. Based on the mathematical model being used, the obtained result was found to be theoretically optimal\n",
      "Combining the feature vectors\n",
      "Information on the secondary structure, hydrogen bonding propensities, and Van der Waals’ interaction has to be integrated. We can simply add the different feature vectors into a new vector that contains information from different aspects, |p > = |p1 > + |p2 > + |p3 > + |p4 > + |p5 >, |r > = |r1 > + |r2 > + |r3 >. Thereafter, the computation can be performed directly with this new feature vector\n",
      " (6) <p|M|r>=<p1|+<p2|+<p3|+<p4|+<p5|M|r1>+|r2>+|r3> \n",
      "However, Equation (6) will lead to cross terms such as <p1|M|r2 >. Assuming that p1 indicates the protein secondary structure information and that r2 indicates the RNA hydrogen bonding information, then the computation of <p1|M|r2 > is nonsensical because combining different kinds of information is theoretically meaningless. Thus, we selected another combining method. We computed five scores using each feature vector pairs, respectively, which included: the protein and RNA secondary structures, protein Grantham’s propensities and RNA hydrogen bonding, protein Zimmerman’s propensities and RNA hydrogen bonding, protein Kyte-Doolittle propensities and RNA Van der Waals’ interaction, and protein Bull-Breese propensities and RNA Van der Waals’ interaction. Here the Grantham and Zimmerman scores are both characterizing the protein hydrogen bonds, the Kyte-Doolittle and Bull-Breese scores are both characterizing the protein Van der Waals’ interaction\n",
      "The five scores must be combined to generate a final score. Given that the encoding methods of feature vectors are different, their magnitudes are also different. As a result, the five scores cannot be combined directly. Thus, we transform each score into open interval (0,100). This is realized by a 1–1 map from the real line to (0,100):\n",
      " (7) Y=100πarctan2X‒cc1‒c2+50 \n",
      "Where X is the raw score, Y is the transformed score, c1 = k * m1, c2=k * m2, and c = (c1+ c2)/2 is the mean of c1 and c2. In c1=k*m1, and c2=k*m2, m1 and m2 are the mean vectors of positive and negative sets, respectively. c = (c1+ c2)/2 can be considered as the separate point of interactive pairs and non-interactive pairs. If X> >c, then Y is near 100. If X < <c, then Y is near zero. If X = c, then Y = 50. Thus, the cutoff will be decided at 50, naturally\n",
      "According to this formula, we can transform all five scores into a scale ranging from 0 to 100. We considered two options to combine the five scores. The first is the arithmetic mean of the five scores. The second is to set weights at 1/3, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, and 1/6, respectively, considering the Grantham and Zimmerman scores are both characterizing hydrogen bonds and the Kyte-Doolittle and Bull-Breese scores are both characterizing the Van der Waals’ interaction. We observed the prediction of different cases. The former method is more accurate than the latter. Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the five scores was used as the final score\n",
      "Measuring the performance of the method\n",
      "The definition of Discriminative Power (DP) was adopted from the study of Bellucci et al. [8]\n",
      " (8) DP=∑i∑nθπi‒πn∑i∑nθπi‒πn+∑i∑nθπn‒πi \n",
      "Where πi and πn represent the scores of interactive and non-interactive RNA–protein pairs, respectively. The function θ is defined as follows:\n",
      " (9) θx=1,ifx≥00,ifx<0 \n",
      "After all pairs were reordered with the score provided by our method, DP = 1 if all the interactive pairs are ordered before the non-interactive ones. If all the non-interactive pairs are ordered before interactive ones, then DP = 0. Thus, DP can be used to determine whether the method could discriminate the positive and negative sets well\n",
      "Furthermore, each pair was given a score between 0 and 100 using the method above. The cutoff is naturally decided as 50 according to the formula we used. Thus, a pair is interactive if it has a score over 50; otherwise, the pair is non-interactive. Using this cutoff, we can calculate the accuracy of the prediction\n",
      "Besides the DP value defined above, Matthews correlation coefficients (MCC) can also be used to measure the quality of classification:\n",
      " (10) MCC=TP×TN−FP×FNTP+FPTP+FNTN+FPTN+FN \n",
      "Here, TP is the number of true positives; FP is the number of false positives; TN is the number of true negatives; FN is the number of false negatives\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "First, we used cross-validation to test the classification ability of the method on the training set. Then the ncRNA–Protein Interaction (NPInter) database and several complexes were used to test the ability of the prediction. Finally, we used the method on all human proteins\n",
      "Cross-validation on training set and comparison with CatRAPID\n",
      "Since the CD-HIT tool has been used to delete similar sequences, a 4-fold cross-validation could be performed on the non-redundant training set. The mean DP was taken as the final result. Our method obtained a DP value 90.3% on the non-redundant set. Since there are some similar pairs in the redundant set, a higher discriminative power value 94.3% was obtained on the redundant set. Compared with the results of CatRAPID (78% on the non-redundant set and 90% on the redundant set), this method showed a better ability to discriminate interactive and non-interactive pairs. The Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) was also computed. We obtained an MCC value of 0.74 on the non-redundant set and a higher MCC value of 0.83 on the redundant set. This is consistent with the previous DP results\n",
      "CatRAPID used 7 Å as the cutoff between interacting and non-interacting RNA-protein pairs and RNA sequences shorter than 100 bp were also kept in the training set. To compare with CatRAPID, the method was also tested on the other set when distance cutoff was set at 7 Å and RNA sequences shorter than 100 bp were kept in the training set. A 4 fold cross-validation was performed. We obtained DP values of 90.2% and 91.6% on the non-redundant set and the redundant set, respectively, which were more accurate than CatRAPID. MCC values were 0.77 on the non-redundant set and 0.78 on the redundant set\n",
      "Next, we checked if the results were improved when five scores were combined. If the combining results were less accurate than the prediction using any single score, then the combination of different information would be meaningless. We considered the five scores separately. The DP for each score is presented in Table 2. The DPs of different scores were not at the same level. However, the combining result was more accurate than the result of each single group. This proved that our method of combining was effective. The same process was repeated on the redundant set. The DP value obtained after combination was still the highest (Table 3). It could be noticed that the DP value is lower than the values of other groups when considering the B-B score alone. When including other 4 groups in the model except the B-B score, the DP value was 89.1% on the non-redundant set and 93.2% on the redundant set. Thus, the B-B score was kept in the model. These results showed that the five groups of vectors do contain different information that is related to RNA-protein interaction. So the classification is more accurate when more groups are used together. Even though K-D and B-B scores are both using information of Van der Waal’s propensities, Grantham and Zimmerman scores are both using information of hydrogen bonding, the ways these vectors were coded are very different\n",

      "We further checked whether a strict sequence similarity cutoff for the non-redundant training set would influence the prediction performance dramatically. When a strict sequence similarity cutoff was used (0.3 for protein and 0.8 for RNA), 21 pairs were deleted from the non-redundant training set. A DP value of 87.1% was then obtained. The result was still more accurate than CatRAPID (78% on the non-redundant set)\n",
      "Testing on NPInter database\n",
      "In the following section, we used the whole non-redundant training set to train the method, and tested the method’s performance on another database. The NPInter database (http://bioinfo.ibp.ac.cn/NPInter/) contains many ncRNA–protein pairs from different species including Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Escherichia coli, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These ncRNA–protein pairs can be separated into eight groups [19]\n",

      "All pairs belong to a positive set (interactive). We considered groups 1, 5, and 6 to have direct evidence of interaction. The rest of the groups were considered to have indirect evidence. Since the RNAsubopt software will only process the first 4095 nucleotides if the input RNA is too long, sequences longer than 4095 were deleted. Finally, 74 pairs with direct evidence of interaction and 41 pairs with indirect evidence were obtained. The CD-HIT tool was used to check if there is significant similarity between the training set and the pairs from NPInter. When both cutoffs were set at 0.9 for protein and RNA sequences, CD-HIT showed that there was no overlapping. Among the 74 pairs with direct evidence, 48 pairs have scores over 50, suggesting that 65% of the interactive pairs were predicted. Among the 41 pairs with indirect evidence, we predicted 27 pairs, which accounted for 66%\n",
      "Both pairs with direct and indirect evidence (115 pairs) were used as the positive set. Then we used another 115 pairs randomly from the non-redundant negative training set as the negative set. A DP value of 91.7% was obtained, which was higher than the result of CatRAPID (85%). The MCC value was 0.64, which also indicates acceptable classification ability\n",
      "By shuffling pairs in the non-redundant negative training set, we built a randomized set containing 327 pairs. The mean value of predicted interaction scores on this set was 32.71 and the distribution of the predicted interaction scores is displayed in Additional file 3: Figure S1. We further randomly selected 115 of them as the negative set. When this new negative set was used, a DP value of 86.7% was obtained for the positive set, which includes both pairs with direct and indirect evidence (115 pairs). These results confirmed that the classification performance of lncPro is satisfactory\n",
      "Testing on complexes\n",
      "We also studied the performance of the method on several complexes. First, we took MRP, RNase P, PRC-2, and LSD1/CoREST/REST complex into consideration. The RNA sequences of MRP and RNase P were obtained from the Functional RNA Database (fRNAdb; http://www.ncrna.org/frnadb). The sequence of HOTAIR and MEG3 were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The protein sequences were obtained from the Uniprot database (http://www.uniprot.org/)\n",
      "The human MRP complex contains one RNA sequence and ten protein sequences: hPop1, hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp29, Rpp30, Rpp38, and Rpp40. RNase P is another complex inside the human body. RNase P shares proteins with the MRP system but has a different RNA sequence. Previous studies focused on MRP and RNase P [20,21]. The results can be summarized as follows. hPop1, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp29, and Rpp38 have direct interactions with the corresponding RNA, whereas hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp30, and Rpp40 have relatively weak interactions. We applied the method on these two complexes. The results are shown in Table 4. Considering hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp30, and Rpp40 are non-interactive, we then correctly predicted 70% (7 of 10) of the interactions for the MRP and RNase P complexes\n",
      "It is worth noting that most of the complexes (14 out of 18) we used to train the model exist in ribosome, which could potentially lead to a biased prediction model. Therefore, in order to validate the method, lncPro needs to be tested on non-ribosome complexes. The PCR-2 complex contains four protein units: Ezh2, Eed, Suz12, and RBBP4. Their Uniprot IDs are Q15910, O75530, Q15022, and Q09028, respectively. All four proteins were predicted as interactive with HOTAIR (has a score above 50). Ezh2 was predicted to be the main RNA-binding unit. These results are in agreement with known experimental results [22,23]. The interaction scores are listed in Table 5. Besides HOTAIR, it is known that MEG3 also interacts with PCR-2 [24]. lncPro successfully predicted these interactions as well (Table 5). The LSD1/CoREST/REST complex contains three protein units: LSD1, CoREST, and REST. The corresponding Uniprot IDs are O60341, Q9UKL0, and Q13127. All these three proteins are predicted as interactive with HOTAIR (Table 6), among which LSD1 is predicted as the main RNA-binding unit. These predictions are also consistent with known experimental results [25,26]. Therefore, the acceptable prediction performance on non-ribosome complexes proved that our model is valid\n",

      "Next, lncPro was tested on non-ribosome complexes of other species besides human. The MSL complex of Drosophila melanogaster contains two RNA sequences (roX1 and roX2; collected from http://www.noncode.org) and five protein sequences (MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MLE, and MOF; collected from Uniprot database). It is known that both roX1 and roX2 have interactions with MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, and MLE [27,28]. The prediction scores given by lncPro are presented in Table 7. Since all eight predicted interaction scores between two RNAs and these four proteins are above 50, both roX1 and roX2 are predicted to be interactive with MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, and MLE. This is in agreement with known results. The predicted interaction scores between roX1, roX2 and MOF are also above 50, which suggest that MOF might also have potential interaction with roX1 and roX2\n",

      "Most well-studied lncRNAs are located in the nucleus of cells. Recently, non-coding RNAs have been found to be predominantly localized in the nucleus [29]. Therefore, it is natural to obtain higher interaction scores between nuclear proteins and non-coding RNAs. We used our method to see whether the scores of the nuclear proteins are indeed higher than those of other proteins\n",
      "Protein sequences of Homo sapiens were downloaded from the Swiss-Prot database (20224 protein sequences). Among these 20224 protein sequences, 5575 were annotated as the nuclear protein according to the Cellular Component of Gene Ontology (GO:0005634, nucleus, downloaded from BioMart). The ID lists of 20224 overall proteins and 5575 nuclear proteins were presented in Additional file 4: Table S3. For each given lncRNA, we compared the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the nuclear protein scores to that of the overall protein scores. One-tail Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test if the two distributions are the same. With regard to the RNAs in the human MRP complex, Rnase P complex, and HOTAIR RNA, the p-values are 1.02E-16, 2.51E-125, and 2.18E-77, respectively. CDF images of the three lncRNAs are presented in Figure 2. We further collected the lncRNAs of Homo sapiens from the lncRNA database (http://www.lncrnadb.com), and deleted those sequences longer than 3000 due to the low computation speed of RNAsubopt software when dealing with long RNA sequences. Finally, 72 human lncRNAs were obtained. With the cutoff set at 0.05, 79.1% (57 out of 72) of these lncRNAs have significant p-values (Additional file 5: Table S4). Thus, most of these human lncRNAs we collected have significantly higher interaction scores with nuclear proteins\n",
      "Figure 2 Cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of different RNAs. The black curve is the CDF of scores between this RNA and human proteins, and the red curve is the CDF of scores between this RNA and human nuclear proteins. The x-axis indicates the score obtained by our method; the Y-axis indicates proportion\n",
      "Following a similar procedure, we also compared the CDF of the RNA-binding protein scores to that of the overall protein scores for each given lncRNA. Among the 20224 protein sequences of Homo sapiens we collected, 639 were annotated as the RNA-binding proteins according to the Cellular Component of Gene Ontology (GO:0003723, RNA binding, downloaded from BioMart, Additional file 4: Table S3). 56.9% (41 out of 72) sequences have significant p-values (Additional file 6: Table S5). Thus, more than half of these lncRNAs have significantly higher predicted interaction scores with known RNA-binding proteins\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "In this study, we introduced a new method lncPro for the prediction of protein associations with lncRNAs. Compared with existing methods, our method shortened the time for training matrix M. This matrix was also found to be theoretically optimal based on the model being used. Our method is computational friendly and does not lead to nonsensical cross terms. The comparison results with CatRAPID also show that our method has enhanced abilities of predicting the associations between lncRNAs and proteins. Specifically, we found the human lncRNAs we collected tend to interact with nuclear proteins and RNA-binding proteins\n",
      "However, the process of finding proteins that directly interact with a given lncRNA is still unsatisfactory because of the large number of proteins. Only when the complex is provided can the prediction of interaction within the complex be more accurate. Also, most RNA-protein pairs in our training set exist in the ribosome, so the training data might not be general enough. Though we tested the method on some non-ribosome complexes and it performed well. We should still be aware of the limited range of cases being used. To conduct a more accurate prediction, further work needs to be performed and more information should be considered. The use of Fisher’s linear discriminant method provides direction on how to incorporate different information into the prediction process\n",
      "Another thing is that lncPro meets some computational issues when dealing with very long non-coding RNAs. This is limited by the computational ability of RNA secondary structure prediction program. We will update lncPro when new software is available. When we study a long RNA sequence, sometimes we are only interested in certain sections of this sequence. lncPro can be applied if the particular section is not too long\n",

The development of these EBV-linked diseases is associated with the presence of nine viral latent proteins, including the nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2). The EBNA2 protein plays a crucial role in EBV infection through its ability to activate transcription of both host and viral genes. As part of this function, EBNA2 associates with several host transcriptional regulatory proteins, including the Tfb1/p62 (yeast/human) subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and the histone acetyltransferase CBP(CREB-binding protein)/p300, through interactions with its C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). In this manuscript, we examine the interaction of the acidic TAD of EBNA2 (residues 431–487) with the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH and CBP/p300 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) and transactivation studies in yeast. NMR studies show that the TAD of EBNA2 binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Tfb1 (Tfb1PH) and that residues 448–471 (EBNA2448–471) are necessary and sufficient for this interaction. NMR structural characterization of a Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex demonstrates that the intrinsically disordered TAD of EBNA2 forms a 9-residue α-helix in complex with Tfb1PH. Within this helix, three hydrophobic amino acids (Trp458, Ile461 and Phe462) make a series of important interactions with Tfb1PH and their importance is validated in ITC and transactivation studies using mutants of EBNA2. In addition, NMR studies indicate that the same region of EBNA2 is also required for binding to the KIX domain of CBP/p300. This study provides an atomic level description of interactions involving the TAD of EBNA2 with target host proteins. In addition, comparison of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex with structures of the TAD of p53 and VP16 bound to Tfb1PH highlights the versatility of intrinsically disordered acidic TADs in recognizing common target host proteins\n",
      "Author Summary\n",
      "Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to a number of human diseases and the nuclear antigen EBNA2 is one of nine viral latent proteins that plays a key role in EBV-linked diseases. EBNA2 activates expression of both viral and host gene in part through interaction between its C-terminal acidic transactivation domain (TAD) and a number of host transcriptional regulatory proteins including the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) and the histone acetyltransferase CBP/p300. In this manuscript, we demonstrate that the TAD of EBNA2 binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH and determine a three-dimensional structure of a complex between EBNA2 and Tfb1/p62. The structure shows that three hydrophobic residues from the TAD of EBNA2 make key interactions at the complex interface and these same residues also play an important role in the binding to CBP/p300. Comparison of the structure of the EBNA2-Tfb1 complex with complexes containing acidic TADs from other proteins (p53 and VP16) bound to the same Tfb1/p62 target highlights the inherent versatility of these intrinsically disordered domains and how minor variations in positioning of key hydrophobic residues allows them to bind to common targets using different functional interfaces\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a double-stranded DNA-based virus that infects more than 90% of the world's adult population [1]. The high level of infectivity is due to the fact that the EBV can be easily transmitted through the exchange of saliva from an infected individual [2]. Once transmitted, the EBV infects epithelial cells and, in particular, B cells [3]. Upon primary infection of B cells, the EBV activates gene expression of proliferative elements in its latent phase [4]. During the latent phase, the host cells are slowly transformed to the point of immortalization, and this helps insure the persistence of the virus [5]. It is in this latent phase that most of the EBV-related diseases, including Hodgkin's lymphomas [6], [7], Burkitt's lymphomas [8], [9], nasopharyngeal carcinomas [10], [11] and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders [12], [13] are manifested\n",
      "Most of the EBV associated diseases are characterized by the presence of at least one of the nine viral latent proteins (review in [14]). These nine proteins include six nuclear antigens (EBNA), EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C and EBNA-LP, and three latent membrane proteins (LMP), LMP1, LMP2A and LMP2B. Following primary infection with the EBV, all nine latent proteins are expressed in B-cells and this can lead to cellular immortalization [15]–[19]. The pathway to B-cell immortalization depends on a precise interplay between the EBV latent proteins and a number of different host factors [15]. In particular, it is known that EBNA2, EBNA3C and LMP1 are key elements for B-cells immortalization [16]–[18] and that EBNA2 plays an important role in regulating expression of the other two proteins [20]–[23]\n",
      "EBNA2 is thus an essential latent protein required for B lymphocyte immortalization [16], [24] and its transforming capacity is directly linked to its ability to activate expression of both viral and host genes (5–9). Although EBNA2 does not contain a DNA-binding domain (DBD), it activates gene expression through a series of protein-protein interactions with host transcriptional regulatory proteins [25]. In order to activate transcription, EBNA2 must first bind to either the host CBF1/RBP-Jκ, or PU.1 proteins through interactions with its RBP-Jκ-binding domain (RBP-J) [26]–[29]. Once bound to either the CBF1/RBP-Jκ or PU.1 proteins, EBNA2 targets consensus sites in viral and host gene promoters using the DNA-binding domain of these host proteins [30]–[32]. In addition to forming protein-protein interactions with its RBP-J-binding domain, EBNA2 associates with a number of host transcriptional regulatory proteins, including general transcription factors (TFs), histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and chromatin remodelling complexes through interactions involving its C-terminal acidic transactivation domain (TAD; [33]–[35])\n",
      "It has been previously shown that the TAD of EBNA2 is between residues 431 and 487 at the extreme C-terminus of the protein [36]. This region of EBNA2 contains a number of acidic amino acids (Asp and Glu) as well as several hydrophobic/aromatic residues [37]. The amino acid composition of the TAD from EBNA2 is similar to a number of human and viral TADs, including the human tumor suppressor protein p53 (p53) and the herpes simplex viral protein 16 (VP16). Not surprisingly, the TAD of EBNA2 targets similar factors as other acidic TADs from viral and mammalian proteins. including the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB; [35]), the p62/Tfb1 (human/yeast) subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH; [33]), the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 40 (TAF40; [35]) and the histone acetyltransfereases (HAT) CBP (CREB-binding protein)/p300 [38]. These interactions involve the acidic TAD since mutating Trp458 to Thr (W458T mutant) within the TAD of EBNA2 disrupts its binding to TFIIB, TFIIH, TAF40 and CBP/p300 resulting in reduced transactivation activity [33], [35], [38]\n",
      "Despite the essential role that interactions of the TAD of EBNA2 with host target proteins play in EBV infectivity, there are currently no detailed structural studies describing such interactions. In this manuscript, we structurally characterize the interaction of the acidic TAD of EBNA2 with the p62/Tfb1 subunit of TFIIH using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR chemical shift perturbation studies are used to define the minimal region from the intrinsically disordered TAD of EBNA2 required for binding to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain located at the N-terminal of Tfb1 (Tfb1PH). NMR structure determination reveals formation of an α-helix within the TAD of EBNA2, and show that three hydrophobic residues within this helix make key interactions at the interface with Tfb1PH. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies and transactivation studies in yeast using mutants of EBNA2 support the importance of these three hydrophobic residues for both the binding to Tfb1PH as well as the in vivo transactivation activity with the TAD of EBNA2. In addition, NMR chemical shift perturbation studies indicate that similar residues of EBNA2 are required for binding to the KIX domain of CBP/p300 (CBP KIX). This study provides the atomic level description of interactions involving the TAD of EBNA2 with target host proteins. In addition, comparison of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex with structures of the TAD of p53 and VP16 bound to Tfb1PH highlights the versatility of intrinsically disordered acidic TADs in recognizing common target host proteins\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The TAD of EBNA2 binds to the PH domain of the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH\n",
      "It has been previously shown that EBNA2 interacts with the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH and that the interaction, in vivo, requires Trp458 within the TAD of EBNA2 [33]. In addition, we have previously shown that that the acidic TADs of p53 and VP16 bind to the PH domain of the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH [39]–[41]. To determine whether the PH domain of Tfb1 (Tfb1PH; residues 1–115 of Tfb1) interacts with the TAD of EBNA2 (EBNA2431–487; residues 431–487 of EBNA2) in a similar manner as the TADs of VP16 and p53, we performed NMR chemical shift perturbation studies. In the initial experiments, incremental additions of unlabeled EBNA2431–487 to 15N-labeled Tfb1PH cause significant changes in both the 1H and 15N chemical shifts for several signals of Tfb1PH in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (\n",
      "Figure 1A\n",
      " and Supplementary Figure S1A). When mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of Tfb1PH, the residues exhibiting significant chemical shift changes are located within the β5, β6 and β7 strands (Supplementary Figure S1B), and these changes are very similar to those observed when the TADs of p53 and VP16 bind to Tfb1PH [40], [41]. In the second set of experiments, incremental additions of unlabeled Tfb1PH to 15N-labeled EBNA2431–487 (\n",
      "Figure 1B\n",
      ") cause significant changes in both the 1H and 15N chemical shifts for several signals of EBNA2431–487 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. In both sets of NMR experiments (\n",
      "Figure 1A and 1B\n",
      "), the chemical shift changes support the formation of an EBNA2431–487-Tfb1PH complex in intermediate to fast exchange on the NMR time scale. In addition, the experiments with the 15N-labeled EBNA2431–487 indicate that the TAD of EBNA2 is intrinsically disordered in the unbound state and that only 15–20 amino acids within this region are affected by the binding of Tfb1PH (\n",

      "[33]. To determine whether Tfb1PH interacts with EBNA2448–471 in a similar manner as EBNA2431–487, NMR chemical shift perturbation studies were performed by incremental addition of unlabeled EBNA2448–471 to 15N-labeled Tfb1PH. Virtually identical changes are observed in both the 1H and 15N chemical shifts of Tfb1PH in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum when compared to the changes induced by EBNA2431–487 (\n",
      "Figure 1 C–D\n",

      "Although the TAD of EBNA2 has been reported to interact with a number of transcriptional regulators [33]–[35], [38], there are currently no detailed structural studies characterizing the EBNA2 TAD in complex with one of its targets. Given that residues 448–471 of EBNA2 are sufficient for binding to Tfb1PH, we determined the three dimensional structure of a Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex by heteronuclear NMR. The structures of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex (\n",

The three hydrophobic residues are part of a ΦXXΦΦ motif (where Φ is hydrophobic/aromatic and X is any amino acid), a motif that is also found at the recognition interface of several acidic TADs, including p53 and VP16 (Supplementary Figure S2). The most significant contribution comes from Phe462 of EBNA2. In the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex, the aromatic ring of Phe462 forms a cation-π interaction with the guanidinium group of Arg61 and van der Waals interactions with the side chains of Met59 and Met88 from Tfb1PH (\n",

For this assay, EBNA2431–487 and three related mutants (Trp458T, I462S and F462S) were fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of LexA and their activity for a lacZ reporter gene was measured relative to a positive control (LexA-DBD-Gal474–881; residues 74–881 of Gal4 fused to the LexA DBD).

      "EBNA2 interacts with CBP/p300 in a similar fashion as with Tfb1PH\n",
      "Numerous transcriptional regulatory proteins containing acidic TADs have been shown to interact with the homologous histone acetyl transferases (HATs), CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300 (CBP/p300), and these interactions are required for their ability to activate gene expression [38]. In the case of p53, the regulation is quite complex. Four different domains of CBP/p300 have been shown to interact with the TAD of p53 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, including the TAZ1/CH1 domain, the KIX domain (CBP KIX), the TAZ2/CH3 domain and the IBID domain [43], [44]. Interestingly, it has been previously demonstrated that EBNA2 can interact with both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of CBP/p300 and that the W458T mutation within the acidic TAD disrupts these interactions [38]. To determine whether the same residues of EBNA2 that interact with Tfb1PH are also involved in binding to CBP/p300, NMR chemical shift perturbation studies were performed with EBNA2448–471 and CBP KIX (residues 586–672 of human CBP). Addition of unlabeled CBP KIX to a 15N-labeled EBNA2448–471 causes significant changes in both the 1H and 15N chemical shifts of several signals from EBNA2. The signals displaying the most significant changes in the 1H-15N-HSQC spectra belongs to residues composing the ΦXXΦΦ motif of EBNA2 and are very similar to those seen with Tfb1PH (\n",
      "Figure 7\n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "EBNA2 activates expression of both viral and host genes in part through the ability of its acidic TAD to participate in a series of protein-protein interactions with several host transcriptional regulatory proteins, including the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH and CBP/p300 [15], [33], [35], [38]. In this manuscript, we have structurally characterized the interactions of the TAD of EBNA2 with these two host target proteins. NMR chemical shift perturbation studies demonstrate that the TAD of EBNA2 binds to the PH domain of Tfb1 (Tfb1PH), and that residues 448–471 of EBNA2 (EBNA2448–471) are both required and sufficient for the interaction. Structural determination of a Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex indicates that EBNA2448–471 transitions from an intrinsically disordered state to a 9-residue α helix between Asp455 and Glu463 upon binding to Tfb1PH. Within this 9-residue helix of EBNA2448–471, three hydrophobic amino acids (Trp458, Ile461 and Phe462) that form a ΦXXΦΦ motif make a series of key interactions at the interface with Tfb1PH. In addition, there are two potential electrostatic interactions at the interface of the complex involving negatively charged residues from EBNA2 and positively charged residues of Tfb1PH. Mutational studies of the three key hydrophobic residues from the ΦXXΦΦ motif indicate that they are all important for transactivation in a yeast model system. In addition, NMR chemical shift perturbation studies strongly suggest that the same residues of EBNA2 involved in binding Tfb1PH are also required for binding to the KIX domain of CBP\n",
      "Previous in vivo studies have shown that EBNA2 is essential for immortalization of B-cell following EBV infection and that viruses expressing a W458T mutant of EBNA2 lose the ability to transform host cells [45]. Unlike the wild-type protein, the W458T EBNA2 mutant fails to interact with a number of transcriptional regulatory factors including TFIIB, TAF40 TFIIH, CBP and PCAF [33]–[35], [38] and this likely explains the decreased infectivity associated with the mutant viruses. In agreement with these studies, our experiments demonstrate that Trp458 is the first hydrophobic residue of a ΦXXΦΦ motif that is important for binding to both Tfb1PH and CBP KIX. The NMR structure of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex shows that Trp458 plays a key role at the interface with Tfb1PH, and this is supported by a loss of binding in ITC studies and diminished transactivation activity in yeast with the W458T mutant. In addition, the structural characterization of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex reveals that Phe462 maybe more important than Trp458, as it appears to dictate the location of the ΦXXΦΦ motif on the surface to Tfb1PH through formation of a key cation-π interaction with Arg61 of Tfb1PH. The importance of Phe462 is supported by ITC and yeast activation studies with the F462S mutant of EBNA2 as well as ITC studies with the R61A mutant of Tfb1PH. Therefore, it is likely that Phe462 is also a key residue in EBNA2 function\n",
      "Like EBNA2, several other transcription factors containing acidic TADs have been shown to bind to the Tfb1/p62 subunit of TFIIH, and this interaction is crucial to their ability to activate expression of target genes [33], [46]–[49]. Previously, we have shown that both p53 and VP16 also bind to TFIIH through interactions between the PH domain of Tfb1/p62 and a small region within their acidic TAD [40], [41]. Like the TAD of EBNA2, the intrinsically disordered TADs of p53 and VP16 both form 9-residue α helices upon binding Tfb1PH that contains an important ΦXXΦΦ motif (Supplementary Figure S2). For all three TADs, a Phe residue is located at the third hydrophobic position of the motif, and the residue likely functions as the anchor point for the helix on Tfb1PH. This is consistent with previous studies showing that substituting for Phe residues within several acidic TADs dramatically reduces their ability to activate transcription [40], [50], [51]\n",
      "Although the acidic TADs of p53, VP16 and EBNA2 all bind to the same region of Tfb1PH, the composition and spatial arrangement of the first and second hydrophobic residue within the ΦXXΦΦ motifs differs in all three cases. These two hydrophobic residues appear to help establish the location of key negatively charged residues in the TAD so that they are in position to form electrostatic interactions with positively charged amino acids in Tfb1PH (\n",
      "Figure 8\n",
      " and Supplementary Figure S4). Each complex contains two key electrostatic interactions involving negatively charged residues from the TADs, but the interactions with the TAD of EBNA2 are slightly different than those seen with p53 and VP16. In all three cases, a negatively charged residue located at the second position of the ΦXXΦΦ motif forms an electrostatic interaction with Arg61 of Tfb1PH. For both p53 and VP16, this residue is a Glu whereas for EBNA2 this residue is an Asp. For the second electrostatic interaction, the first residue after the ΦXXΦΦ motif (ΦXXΦΦE) in EBNA2 (Glu463) interacts with Arg86 from Tfb1PH. In contrast, the second electrostatic interaction observed with p53 and VP16 occurs between a Glu residue located at the second position after the ΦXXΦΦ motif (ΦXXΦΦXE) and Lys57 from Tfb1PH\n",

The complete helix of VP16 is shown in E, whereas the three key hydrophobic residues of the ΦXXΦΦ motif (F475, M478 and F479) of VP16 are highlighted in stick (magenta) on the surface of Tfb1PH in F\n",
      "One of the key features observed for p53 is that phosphorylation of Ser46 in p53 enhances its affinity for Tfb1PH/p62PH by forming an additional electrostatic interaction with a lysine side chain located in the loop linking β1 and β2 strands [40]. Ser46 is the residue immediately prior to the first residue of the helix in p53. There is no equivalent phosphorylation site in VP16, but it contains a negatively charged residue in the first position of the helix that helps to stabilize the α helix through a favourable interaction with the helix dipole [41], [52], [53]. Like VP16, there are no apparent phosphorylation sites located at the N-terminus of the EBNA2 α-helix, and there is a negatively charged residue in the first position of the helix. Thus, it appears that binding of the two viral activators to Tfb1PH/p62PH is not controlled by phosphorylation as is seen with the host p53 protein\n",
      "In conclusion, our results provide a structural view of how EBNA2 usurps the host transcription factors TFIIH and CBP/p300 to modulate viral and host gene expression. In addition, they provide insights into the role of TFIIH and CBP in EBNA2 function as well as supporting the key role of Trp458 in EBNA2 activation. The structure of the Tfb1PH-EBNA2448–471 complex together with the ITC and transactivation studies with mutant proteins, point to a key role for Phe462 in EBNA2 function and indicates that it plays a similar role to the analogous residue in other acidic TADs such as p53 and VP16. In addition, this study highlights the inherent versatility of disordered acidic TADs and, particularly how minor variations in the position of hydrophobic and acidic residues allows them to form distinct structural interfaces with a common target protein\n",

      "The incidence of Down syndrome (DS) in Egypt varies between 1∶555 and 1∶770 and its screening by triple test is becoming increasingly popular nowadays. Results, however, seem inaccurate due to the lack of Egyptian-specific information needed for risk calculation and a clear policy for programme implementation. Our study aimed at calculation and validation of the triple marker medians used in screening Egyptian females as well as to recommend programme conventions to unify screening in this country\n",

      "The study was conducted on 668 Egyptian women, in weeks 15–20 of pregnancy as proven by sonar. Chorionic gonadotropin (CG), α-fetoprotein (AFP) and unconjugated oestriol (uE3) were measured on Siemens Immulite analyzer. Medians of the three parameters were calculated, regressed against gestational age (GA) and weighted by the number of participants/week. Equations were derived to adjust each parameter to the maternal weight and were centered on the median Egyptian weight. Prisca software was fed with the above data, multiples-of-median (MoM) and DS risks were calculated and the screening performance was evaluated at a mid-trimester risk cutoff of 1∶270\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Log-linear [AFP/uE3 = 10(A+B*GA)] and exponential equations [CG = A*e (B*GA)] were derived and the regressed medians were found to follow similar patterns to other Asian and Western medians. Oestriol was always lowest (even halved) while CG and AFP were intermediate. A linear reciprocal model best fitted weight distribution among Egyptians and successfully adjusted each parameter to a weight of 78.2 kg. Epidemiological monitoring of these recommendations revealed satisfactory performance in terms of 6.7% initial positive rate and 1.00 grand MoM\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "Adoption of the above recommendations is hoped to pave the way to a successful DS screening programme tailored to Egyptian peculiarities\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosomal aneuploidy in live born infants. The overall incidence of DS is approximately 1 in 800 births in the general population [1]. Figures in Egypt vary between 1 in 555 in one study [2] to 1 in 770 in another [3]. In 2007, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that all pregnant women, regardless of their age, should be offered screening for DS. Those with high risk should be confirmed by an invasive diagnostic procedure like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling [4]\n",
      "Second trimester screening is traditionally based on the “triple test”. In this test, three maternal serum markers [α-fetoprotein (AFP), chorionic gonadotropin (CG) and unconjugated oestriol (uE3)] are measured and used to modify the women’s prior risk (based on her age) to yield a patient specific DS risk [5]. In order to compensate for variation of these markers with gestational age, the measured concentrations are divided by the median marker levels in the relevant gestational week yielding “Multiples of the Median (MoM)”. Furthermore, these MoMs are adjusted to compensate for factors, other than DS, that alter marker levels [6]\n",
      "Most commercial software packages rely on the same algorithm (overlapping multivariate Gaussian distributions) for risk calculation. The quality of the results obtained depends therefore, among others, on the following variables: analytical performance of the immunoassays used [7]; accurate dating of pregnancy [8], proper choice of medians used to calculate the MoMs, and of valid factors for MoM adjustment and on the selection of suitable population parameters [9]\n",
      "Despite the increasing number of triple test requests, risk calculations have not been tailored to the Egyptian peculiarities, leading to gross errors in risk prediction and a greater proportion of women unnecessarily exposed to invasive techniques. Aiming at bridging this serious gap in our practice, the current study was conducted\n",
      "Considering the economic situation of our region, adding a fourth test (quadruple testing) or combination with first trimester screening, though more efficient, was projected to decrease programme uptake. A wide-spread, less expensive but less efficient programme was thought to be more valuable to our community\n",
      "Materials and Methods\n",
      "The study was conducted on 668 pregnant women spanning gestational weeks 15+0 to 20+6. They were recruited from the Obstetric department of the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University between December 2011 and November, 2012. Gestational dating for all women was based on biparietal diameter measurement, while dating based on last menstrual period (LMP) was only used to calculate the magnitude of error in dating and in subsequent risk calculation. Ultrasonography was also used to exclude multiple pregnancies and gross fetal anomalies. Blood samples were extracted from each participant and serum was separated and stored at −20°C for a period that did not exceed 6 days to ensure analyte stability [10]. All participants signed informed consent accepting all the procedures to be done. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of The Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. All specimens were analysed for AFP, CG and uE3 using Immulite 2000 analyser (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics) and their corresponding reagents and calibrators; catalogue numbers: L2KAP2, L2KCG2 and L2KUE32, respectively). The technique is a solid-phase, enzyme-amplified chemiluminescence immunoassay that was run fully-automated according to the manufacturer instructions. Strict adherence to quality assurance procedures were followed throughout the study including acceptable performance of a two-level quality control material introduced in each run. DS risk was calculated using Siemens PRISCA Prenatal Risk Calculation Software v. 4.0, catalogue Number: 402692. Calculations were based on the population parameter set of Cuckle [11]. The used version of Prisca does not allow selecting between different parameter sets\n",
      "Medians values of the three parameters were calculated for each completed gestational week. These medians were smoothened by regression against the gestational weeks (average decimal weeks). A log-linear model best fitted the relation between GA and both AFP and uE3 whereas CG was described by an exponential equation. These regression equations were weighted based on the square root of the number of samples in each week\n",
      "To derive adjustment factors for maternal weight, a linear reciprocal model [12] was found to best fit the weight distribution of Egyptian women. An equation was derived to adjust the MoMs of each of the three parameters to maternal weight. Prisca default adjustment factors for insulin-treated diabetes, smoking and in-vitro fertilization were accepted. Since the observed medians were calculated from a homogeneous subset of Egyptians belonging to the same ethnic origin (Arab panethnicity) [13], no correction was warranted for ethnicity. A priori DS risk was calculated according to the formula of Snijders et al [14]. Data were statistically analysed using IBM SPSS v. 20\n",
      "Results\n",
      "The 668 studied females were fairly equally distributed among weeks 15 to 20, with no less than a hundred participants/week. Their ages at sampling time ranged between 15.3 and 47.7 years; median (interquartile range) were 27.8 (24.7–30.9) y with 93.3% younger than 35 y. Maternal weight ranged between 50 and 103 kg; median: 78.2 (76.3–82.6) kg. None of them declared smoking and only 1.6% were on insulin treatment. Raw data are presented in table S1\n",
      "The observed medians of the three parameters are given in table 1. When regressed against the average GA for each week gestational age, the equations describing the relation of median AFP and uE3 to gestational age were log-linear having the general layout: AFP (IU/ml) or uE3 (ng/ml) = 10(A+B*GA). For CG, the equation was exponential; CG (mIU/ml) = A*e(B*GA). These equations were weighted by the square root of the number of participants/week. Details of the equations are given in table 2. Using these median analyte values, the grand median MoM for each of the three parameters (without regard for the gestational week) was always 1.00. Figure 1 compares Egyptian medians with those in Korea [15] and a number of Western areas compiled by Vranken et al [16]\n",

      "The linear reciprocal model for weight correction yielded the following general layout formula: Weight-adjusted MoM = ; where F = , Wt is the maternal weight in kg, F for AFP = , for uE3 =  and for CG = . Weight correction was centred on the median weight of the screened population (78.2 kg) and is applicable within the studied weight range (50 to 103 kg). Within this weight range, weight-correction factors ranged between 0.91–1.33 for AFP, 0.83–1.02 for uE3 and 0.93–1.25 for CG. Based on these correction factors, a woman’s MoM value may increase up to 120.5% or decrease by 75.2%; particularly at the extremes of weights studied. Such factors were constantly 1.00 for the three analytes for women weighing 78.2 kg\n",
      "Using the Egyptian-specific medians and weight correction factors; the DS risk for 45 out of the 668 screened women exceeded the risk cutoff adopted (1∶270 at sampling time). This figure equates to an initial positive rate (IPR) of 6.7%. When software default medians (European-based) were used, 76 cases were risky (IPR = 11.4%); including the 45 women identified risky when using Egyptian medians and extra 31 considered non-risky. In general, 67.7% of women were considered less risky when calculations were based on Egyptian medians, particularly in weeks 17 to 20. Figure 2 displays the general trend for overestimation of DS risk when default medians were blindly accepted\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pone.0110370.g002Figure 2 Comparison between risks (1:n) generated using Egypt-specific medians and software default medians\n",
      "Both prior (based on age) and posterior (based on Egyptian medians) risks were concordant (risk >1∶270) in 596 (89.2%) of females and were <1∶270 in 10 (1.5%) of them. The risks were discrepant in the remaining 62 (9.3%) participants; 27 (4.0%) were risky based on their ages only but turned-out to be non-risky after introducing biochemical markers into risk calculation, and 35 (5.3%) had an opposite scenario\n",
      "An error of at least 1 week was found in 8.5% of the studied females when last menstrual period was used for gestational dating. In half of them, the difference was 2 weeks or more. Such dating method caused doubling of initial positive rate from 6.7% to 13.9% compared to sonographic dating\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "Successful, wide-spread implementation of a national screening programme for DS in Egypt is hampered by a number of hurdles. Developing a set of median values for each biochemical marker in every week of gestation comes on top of the list. Reliance on medians originating from other communities or accepting software defaults undermine the philosophy of such a population-specific programme and is postulated to be the primary cause for poor performance in our country. Other obstacles exist and need to be rectified as well. The current study was planned to address these issues aiming at promulgating a screening policy worthwhile adoption in Egypt. The study was conducted on 668 Egyptian females making sure that at least a hundred participants were included in each week between 15 and 20 as has been recommended [17]. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, (ACMG) technical standards and guideline for DS screening state that ideally 100 samples for each gestational week from 15 through 20 should be used to calculate medians [18]. Definition of gestational age was consistently based on measurement of fetal biparietal diameter to circumvent errors associated with last menstrual period calculations. A difference of at least one week was found in 57 (8.5%) females, 14 of them were 2–3 weeks and 15 were 3–5 weeks. This finding underscores the importance of objective gestational dating using sonar [19], [20]; otherwise risk calculation would be erroneously based on analyte medians that belong to gestational ages 2–5 weeks away. Should this error be neglected in the current study, the initial positive rate was found to jump to 13.9%; more than double what sonographic age calculations furnished. It was calculated that an error of 3–4 days in gestational age can approximately double (or halve) the expected DS risk [17]\n",
      "Median values for AFP, CG and uE3 were calculated for each week of the 2nd trimester. Appropriate weighted regression analysis was used to fit the observed data to the GA. These equations are used to predict “smoothened” medians for each week of gestation, minimizing the effect of outliers and giving less weight to weeks with smaller number of participants. When these medians were compared to other geographical regions (Canada, UK, Germany, Belgium and Korea), they showed similar pattern of variation with GA (Figure 1). AFP increased by a constant proportion of 11.7% per week (11.3%–23.5% in the other regions) and uE3 increased by 28.4% (compared to 14.7%–35.7% elsewhere). CG, on the other hand, showed least association with GA, decreasing by 8.0% to 8.8%/week (8.0% to 19.6% in other countries). Errors in GA dating will, then, have its greatest impact on uE3. On a week to week basis, Egyptian AFP medians were second highest among other geographical regions; following Korean medians. Oestriol was lowest all through, particularly when compared to Korean medians that were higher by a factor of 1.6 to 2.1. CG occupied an intermediate position between Korea, Canada and UK (below them) and Belgium and Germany (above both). Interestingly, CG curve showed the least steep decline with GA compared to the five regions. The observed difference in medians is not purely racial, because the quoted measurements were made on Beckman Coulter Access rather than Siemens Immulite used in the current study. Both techniques, however, are immuno-chemiluminescence-based. Asian women who were reported to have the highest AFP, CG and uE3 [21], [22], are still leading even when compared to Egyptians\n",
      "Another potential source of error in DS risk calculation is the adjustment for maternal weight. Weight distribution in our community is different from that in Western, black or Asian communities, and needs to be considered when adjustments to MoMs are to be made. Three formulas were derived and served to adjust measured MoMs to a population median maternal weight of 78.2 kg (compared to 60 kg in a Caucasian-based study [23] and 57.2 kg in a Korean study) [15]. A difference in median weight as small as 2.5 kg was recommended to warrant formula modification to minimize errors in risk calculation [24]. This recommendation highlights the importance of using population-tailored equations. Neveux’s linear reciprocal model better fitted weight distribution in our community than the log-linear model recommended by Reynolds et al [24]\n",
      "Due to the small number of diabetics (only 11 women) and absence of smoking history in the 668 participants, default software correction factors for these potential confounders were accepted. Multiple pregnancies were excluded from the study to avoid “pseudo-risk” calculations. Other suggested covariates (as parity, in vitro fertilization, intra-uterine insemination, analyte concentrations in a previous pregnancy or sex of the fetus) were beyond the scope of the current study. The improvement in screening that can be achieved by incorporating additional clinical factors needs to be balanced against the practical realities involved with the data collection [17]\n",
      "In addition to the above statistical findings, a number of conventions need to be agreed upon by policy makers in order to harmonize results and unify terms across the whole country. The first convention is the time at which risk is to be calculated and expressed; whether mid-trimester (i.e., at sampling-time) or term-risk. The former choice was adopted in the current study. Another decision is the choice of DS risk cut-off that warrants invasive diagnostic procedures. A risk cut-off was set at 1∶270. It is equivalent to the risk of a 35-year old woman in the absence of serum screening. The risk cut-off of a screening test should be set specifically to each country in consideration of the cost and safety of invasive diagnostic procedures, the prevalence of DS, and the age distribution of pregnant women [15]\n",
      "The appropriateness of findings and conventions recommended in the current study was assessed by epidemiological monitoring [25], [26]. Our target was to keep the percentage of women considered screen positive to a figure less than 7%. This figure, often termed initial positive rate (IPR) reached 6.7% in our study; well below our target. In many US laboratories using the same risk cut-off, same test-combination (triple test) and same method of gestational age dating (sonar); IPR was reportedly 6.5% [27]\n",
      "Another statistic calculated was the grand MoM for each of the three measured parameters. It is the median of all 668 MoMs of each parameter; without regard for the gestational week. The target was to keep the 3 grand MoMs as close to unity as possible. All three MoMs were exactly 1.00\n",
      "It’s believed that a similar study has not been done in Egypt, nor in many countries in the Arab region and North Africa, and is hoped that implementation of the above medians, correction factors and conventions will pave the way to a successful national DS screening programme. Considering the ethnic similarities between most of the Arab women (Arab panethnicity), such recommendations can even extend to other countries in the region and would surely be a better option for some of them than accepting literature-based recommendations or software defaults\n",

Here we use intravital imaging to demonstrate that secretion of exosomes from late endosomes is required for directionally persistent and efficient in vivo movement of cancer cells. Inhibiting exosome secretion or biogenesis leads to defective tumour cell migration associated with increased formation of unstable protrusions and excessive directional switching. In vitro rescue experiments with purified exosomes and matrix coating identify adhesion assembly as a critical exosome function that promotes efficient cell motility. Live-cell imaging reveals that exosome secretion directly precedes and promotes adhesion assembly. Fibronectin is found to be a critical motility-promoting cargo whose sorting into exosomes depends on binding to integrins. We propose that autocrine secretion of exosomes powerfully promotes directionally persistent and effective cell motility by reinforcing otherwise transient polarization states and promoting adhesion assembly\n",
      "How cells maintain directional polarity when migrating through a complex environment is not well understood. Here Sung et al. show that autocrine exosome secretion is required for persistent and efficient in vivo cancer cell motility and promotes assembly of adhesion complexes by delivering fibronectin-bound exosomes\n",
      "==== Body\n",
      "Directional cell movement involves the coordination of multiple subcellular processes. In order for cells to migrate effectively, polarization signals and protrusions must be stabilized to form a dominant leading-edge protrusion1. Adhesion assembly is likely to significantly contribute to signal reinforcement at the leading edge1; however, the mechanisms by which cells spatially coordinate adhesion assembly during persistent cell migration are poorly understood. In tissues, the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment adds further complexity that could provide conflicting signals to migrating cells if it is not coordinated with chemical gradients\n",
      "One potential mechanism that could coordinate initial directional signalling with adhesion formation is vesicle trafficking. Polarization of and trafficking from the Golgi apparatus has been shown to regulate cell migration, although the cargoes are unknown234. Endocytic recycling of integrins has also been shown to impact cell motility56. Although early studies focused on long- and short-loop integrin-recycling pathways6, recent data have identified trafficking of the α5β1 integrin to and/or from late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/Lys) compartments as a key step in cell migration78. In addition, we found that the ECM molecule fibronectin (FN) is endocytosed and resecreted from a LE/Lys compartment to promote in vitro migration of fibrosarcoma, breast cancer9 and epicardial10 cells. Finally, although the cargoes are unknown, additional studies pinpoint secretion from LE/Lys compartments as important for leukocyte chemotaxis and epithelial migration1112. Thus, current data suggest that a key decision step in cell migration may be whether otherwise degradatory LE/Lys compartments fuse with the plasma membrane to release important cargo, such as ECM components and their receptors\n",
      "Among the components of LE/Lys, compartments that might affect cellular migration are exosomes. Exosomes are small secreted vesicles that carry bioactive cargoes, including growth factors, angiogenic factors, transmembrane receptors, proteinases, ECM molecules and RNAs13. It has been shown that purified exosomes can promote adhesion and motility of cells1415; however, it is unclear how essential the process of exosome secretion is to cell migration or how it might affect underlying processes such as polarization. It is also unclear how exosome and/or LE/Lys secretion might impact cell migration through complex tissue environments\n",
      "To understand how LE/Lys secretion and exosomes control in vivo cell motility, we performed xenograft tumour cell motility studies in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chick embryos. This system is highly advantageous because it enables high-resolution live-imaging studies of cell migration through a physiologic collagen-rich stromal tissue environment161718. We find that exosome secretion is critical for persistent directional migration of tumour cells in the chick CAM, likely due to stabilization of leading-edge protrusions. We further identify exosomes as critical carriers of ECM that promote adhesion assembly, a key step in leading-edge stabilization192021. Targeting of the ECM molecule FN to exosomes depends on specific binding to integrin receptors, ensuring that ECM secreted on exosomes will match cellular receptors\n",

      "Endolysosomal secretion controls HT1080 migration in vivo\n",
      "To determine the impact of LE/Lys secretion on in vivo motility, we inhibited two canonical regulators of LE/Lys secretion, Rab27a and Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7), in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Rab27a controls plasma membrane docking of multivesicular late endosomes (MVE)22 whereas Syt7 controls fusion of LE/Lys compartments, including MVE, with the plasma membrane2324. Syt7 and Rab27a expression were stably downregulated by the expression of specific targeting short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; Fig. 1a). Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing HT1080 cells carrying the scrambled control (HT1080Scrambled) or target-specific shRNA (HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD), were imaged intravitally after local engraftment or intravenous (i.v.) injection into the CAM of chick embryos (Fig. 1b)1718. Primary tumours formed after engraftment enable the visualization of cells migrating away from the tumour periphery, while i.v. injection enables high-resolution single-cell tracking of individually extravasated cells. After engraftment, the HT1080Scrambled, HT1080Rab27aKD or HT1080Syt7KD cells all formed tumours in the CAM with little obvious difference in tumour size. Examination of the invasive front of each tumour at 4 days after inoculation revealed that fewer KD cells had migrated away from the tumour as compared with control cells (Fig. 1c,d). Following i.v. injection, cells that have extravasated from the bloodstream into the CAM grow to form colonies. Consistent with the previous studies18, individual control HT1080 cells had an elongated morphology and migrated rapidly through the CAM to form dispersed, loosely connected colonies (Fig. 1e,f). In contrast, extravasated HT1080Rab27aKD or HT1080Syt7KD cells exhibited a rounded morphology and formed few colonies that were overall larger in size, suggesting ongoing proliferation but defective migration (Fig. 1e,f)1825\n",
      "Endolysosomal secretion promotes persistent and fast motility\n",
      "To directly measure cancer cell motility in vivo, we performed time-lapse imaging of cancer cells migrating within the CAM. GFP-expressing HT1080Scrambled, HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD were imaged in the CAM for 16 h during a period of 1–3 days after i.v. injection. Analysis of the movies revealed that HT1080Scrambled exhibited polarized migration, allowing them to move in a directionally persistent manner. Conversely, HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells that initially moved in one direction would frequently stop and reverse course (representative cell tracks shown in Fig. 2a, see also Supplementary Movies 1 and 2), leading to diminished overall displacement from the initial position (Fig. 2b,c). HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells also exhibited an overall defect in the total path length travelled by the cells, regardless of the directionality (Fig. 2b,c). To determine whether there was a distinct defect in directionality in KD cells, separate from any defects in overall speed of movement, the persistence index was calculated by dividing the displacement rate by cell speed (Fig. 2d,e). Fully persistent movement would result in a straight migration track and give a persistence index of 1. Control cells had a persistence index of ∼0.4. By contrast, HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells had persistence indexes of ∼0.2, indicating a strong defect in directionally persistent migration, independent of defects in cell speed (Fig. 2e). Wind–Rose plots of representative cell tracks further illustrate that endolysosomal secretion promotes persistent and efficient in vivo migration (Fig. 2f). A similar phenotype was observed in HEp3 squamous carcinoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 1)\n",
      "Endolysosomal secretion controls protrusion dynamics\n",
      "To further identify cellular features of migration regulated by endolysosomal secretion, we performed high-magnification live-cell imaging of cells migrating in the CAM. Analysis of the cellular morphology revealed that HT1080Scrambled cells were much more elongated than cells inhibited for LE/Lys secretion (Fig. 3a,b, see also Supplementary Movie 3). It was also apparent that HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells made more numerous but shorter-lived protrusions. Quantitation of the protrusion dynamics revealed that KD cells had a 50% increase in the number of protrusions formed per frame during migration (Fig. 3c), along with a decrease in the length and persistence of protrusions (Fig. 3d,e). These data indicate that LE/Lys secretion strongly contributes to establishment of a persistent leading-edge protrusion in vivo, which is critical for maintaining the cell directionality during migration. Interestingly, these results are reminiscent of our previous in vitro finding that endolysosomal recycling of ECM promotes the stabilization of leading-edge protrusions9. To determine if Rab27a and Syt7 also control the stability of protrusions in vitro, we performed live imaging and kymography analysis of the movies. We found a similar in vitro phenotype, with HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells making an increased number of short-lived protrusions (Fig. 3f,g). The strong similarity between the in vitro and in vivo phenotypes suggests that we can exploit powerful available in vitro techniques to identify the mechanisms by which endolysosomal secretion controls cell motility\n",
      "Exosomes promote effective cell motility by carrying ECM\n",
      "A specialized endolysosomal compartment that could potentially control cell migration is the MVE, which on fusion with the plasma membrane releases exosome vesicles to the extracellular milieu13. To confirm that exosome secretion is inhibited in HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells, exosomes were purified from conditioned media by serial centrifugation and analysed by NanoSight particle analysis and immunoblotting for the exosome marker flotillin and the ECM molecule FN. NanoSight analysis revealed that HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells secreted 2.2- to 3-fold fewer exosomes/cell than control cells (Fig. 4a). Consistent with the reduction in exosome secretion, the immunodetection of flotillin and FN was similarly reduced in exosome preparations from HT1080Rab27aKD and HT1080Syt7KD cells (Fig. 4b, top panel). However, when an equal number of vesicles was loaded on blots, there was no difference in FN or flotillin levels (Fig. 4b, bottom panel)\n",
      "To determine if autocrine secretion of exosomes was required for in vitro cell motility, live imaging of HT1080Scrambled and HT1080Rab27aKD cells was performed in the absence or presence of purified exosomes. In the absence of exogenously provided exosomes, HT1080Rab27aKD cells had a defect in the speed of migration (Fig. 4c,d, ‘Exo 0' condition). However, unlike the migration in vivo, HT1080Rab27aKD did not exhibit diminished persistence compared with HT1080Scrambled, as quantitated by the persistence index (compare Fig. 4e, ‘Exo 0', to in vivo migration results in Fig. 2e) and visualized in Wind–Rose plots (Fig. 4f). We speculate that this difference reflects the presence of directional cues in vivo that are not present in our in vitro motility environment\n",
      "Exosomes have the potential to control multiple aspects of cell motility, including stimulation of extracellular receptor signalling and as carriers of ECM to promote adhesion formation14152627. As a first test of these possible roles, exosomes purified from control HT1080 cells were added to the cells in two formats—either added into the media at the time of migration like a growth factor (Fig. 4c) or coated overnight onto tissue culture plates similar to ECM coatings (Fig. 4d). On addition of purified exosomes, HT1080Scrambled cells exhibited increased migration speed, especially when exosomes were coated onto culture dishes. Interestingly, the speed defect of HT1080Rab27aKD cells was fully rescued on exosome-coated plates (Fig. 4d) but not with the addition of exosomes into media containing exosome-depleted serum (Fig. 4c). These data suggest that deposition of exosomes to the substrata where it is accessible to the basal cell surface is important for their ability to promote cell migration\n",
      "The presence of FN on exosomes (Fig. 4b), the lamellipodial stability defect of KD cells (Fig. 3) and the selective rescue of Rab27a-KD cells on exosome-coated plates (Fig. 4d) suggest that exosomes may serve a critical function in providing matrix attachment for migrating cells. By immunoprecipitation, FN is on the outside of exosomes, indicating that it is indeed of the expected topology to support adhesion and migration (Supplementary Fig. 2). To determine whether the presence of FN on exosomes is important for their ability to support migration, we prepared FN-depleted exosomes by culturing control cells for 10 days in FN-depleted serum before collecting 48-h conditioned serum-free media for exosome purification. This procedure led to a 2.5-fold decrease in the FN content of exosomes, compared with control preparations (Fig. 4g). When coated onto culture dishes and tested in single-cell motility experiments, FN-depleted exosomes were less efficient at rescuing single-cell motility than control exosomes (compare Fig. 4h to Fig. 4d). Thus, while 10 μg ml−1 coating of control exosomes fully rescued motility of Rab27a-KD cells, twice as many FN-depleted exosomes were required to rescue their motility. The rescue of Rab27a-KD cell motility by 20 μg ml−1 FN-depleted exosomes could be due to remaining FN on the FN-depleted exosomes or to other exosome cargoes\n",
      "The concomitant decrease in FN and the membrane marker flotillin in exosome preparations from Rab27a- and Syt7-KD cells that were loaded according to equal cell number (Fig. 4b, top blot) suggests that FN is not merely a contaminant of our ultracentrifugation (UC) preparation technique. Furthermore, the size distribution of exosomes and microvesicles in our UC fractions were as expected (Fig. 5a) and approximately threefold fewer MVs are secreted by our cells, suggesting that it is exosomes rather than microvesicles that promote cell motility in our system. However, to test the specificity of exosomes in carrying FN and promoting cell motility, we further purified our UC exosome preparations by sedimentation into a density gradient of Optiprep (DG exosomes). Western blot analysis of the fractions revealed that FN was purified in two peaks—one that included the exosome markers HSP70 and flotillin along with the FN-binding integrin α5 subunit and another peak that did not have any of those markers and probably represents FN fibrils not associated with exosomes (Fig. 5b). Microvesicle preparations contained no FN or HSP70 but did contain a small amount of flotillin and α5 integrin, which are both plasma membrane markers and may be found in both types of vesicles. To determine whether our Optiprep-purified exosomes could rescue cell motility defects of Rab27a-KD cells, we coated plates and performed the same live-imaging assay as we had performed with UC-exosomes. Compared with one-step UC-exosomes from the same conditioned media preparation, Optiprep-double purified exosomes were equipotent in their ability to rescue cell motility (Fig. 5d). By comparison, the microvesicle fraction from the same conditioned media was unable to rescue motility. As with the UC-exosomes (Fig. 4h), FN-depleted DG exosomes were less efficient in rescuing cell motility compared with control DG exosomes (Fig. 5c,d)\n",
      "These data are consistent with our recent finding that recycling of endocytosed FN from a LE/Lys compartment drives cell motility9 and suggest that exosomes are key delivery vehicles for that FN. Consistent with this model, we tested whether endocytosed fluorescent FN was likewise secreted by HT1080 cells migrating in the chick CAM. Indeed, 24 h after i.v. injection of DyLight550-FN-loaded HT1080 cells into the chick CAM, we observed incorporation of the endocytosed FN into streak-like structures reminiscent of adhesions associated with cellular protrusions (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Movie 4)\n",
      "To further verify that the secretion of exosomes rather than non-exosomal LE/Lys cargo is required for motility, we knocked down a component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery that is necessary for intraluminal vesicle formation within MVE28. Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) is part of the ESCRT-0 complex, and inhibition of Hrs prevents exosome biogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 4, refs 23, 29). As expected, Hrs KD diminished the release of exosomes into conditioned media (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c) and HT1080HrsKD cells had motility defects in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e) and in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 4f, Exo 0 and 5g, FN 0 conditions). Consistent with our hypothesis that matrix-containing exosomes promote cell motility, the in vitro motility speed defect of HT1080HrsKD cells was fully rescued on culture dishes coated with either exosomes (Supplementary Fig. 4f) or 10 μg ml−1 purified FN (Supplementary Fig. 4g)\n",
      "Secreted exosomes promote assembly of nascent adhesions\n",
      "Our data suggest that a major role of exosomes is to transport ECM and presumably regulate adhesions. To investigate whether exosome-containing MVE are transported to and secreted at specific cellular locations, we performed live confocal imaging of cells expressing the MVE marker mCherry-CD63. To simultaneously visualize adhesions, we expressed GFP-paxillin. As previously reported, CD63-positive tubules and vesicles were observed moving dynamically in cells (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Movie 5). In some cases, these vesicular structures appeared to target peripheral adhesions (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Movie 5, arrows); however, the majority of the CD63 was in endosomes away from the plasma membrane and some CD63-positive endosomes also carried paxillin (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Movie 5, arrowhead)\n",
      "To definitively identify exosome secretion sites, we constructed a novel imaging probe, which has the pH-sensitive GFP-pHLuorin moiety inserted into the first extracellular loop of CD63 (CD63-pHLuorin). Because pHLuorin-GFP fluorescence is quenched at the acidic late endosomal pH, but fluoresces brightly at the neutral pH of the extracellular environment30, it is ideal to track proteins that are exocytosed from endosomes. To validate this construct, we co-expressed it with mCherry-Rab5-Q79L, which both marks and leads to the enlargement of early-to-late-transitioning endosomes31, in control and Rab27a-KD cells. Consistent with the construct marking secretory MVE, pHLuorin-CD63 fluorescence was present on the cell surface of control cells, but not of Rab27a-KD cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, Bafilomycin treatment of Rab27a-KD cells to inhibit acidification of endosomes reveals its presence in internal vesicles. Finally, since many Rab5-positive endosomes will not be fully acidified yet, note the internal co-localization of pHLuorin-CD63 with some Rab5-Q79L endosomes in control cells but less co-localization in Rab27a-KD cells, which should have an accumulation of secretory MVE downstream of early endosomes due to the docking defect22\n",
      "To visualize exosome secretion in migrating cells, wide-field epifluorescence movies of HT1080 cells expressing pHLuorin-CD63 and mCherry-paxillin migrating in two-dimensinal were performed (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Movie 6). Overall, pHLuorin-CD63 fluorescence was observed at the front of the cell in thick ruffles and at the back of the cell at attachment sites. At the back of the cell, a striking feature was prominent ‘slime trails' of fluorescence that were frequently left behind the migrating cells (Fig. 6b,c). Examination of phase-contrast images from the same movies reveals that the rear of the cell is far in advance of the ‘slime trails' and does not reveal any apparent bits of torn-off plasma membrane (Fig. 6b). Furthermore, examination of mCherry-paxillin fluorescence gathered at the same time shows that only green fluorescence is present in the trail (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Movie 6). These data suggest that the primary source of the slime trail is exosomes and not torn-off plasma membrane or large adhesions left behind. These trails appeared to serve an adhesive function based on attachment to membrane at the rear of the cell that is particularly evident in the movies (Supplementary Movie 6). To further analyse the localization of pHLuorin-CD63 with respect to leading-edge protrusions, higher speed movies were taken. Kymographs showing protrusion at the leading edge over time were obtained and revealed that pHLuorin-CD63 was not enriched in the initial flat lamellipodial protrusions (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Movie 7). Instead there was an increased fluorescence in membranes that ruffled back, which could be due to membrane thickness or adhesion of exosomes after the initial membrane protrusion\n",
      "To further define the relationship between exosome secretion and adhesion formation, we performed live total internal reflected fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of cells expressing both pHLuorin-CD63 and mCherry-paxillin (Fig. 7a and Supplementary Movie 8). To visualize newly forming adhesions, movies were taken in actively spreading cells. Interestingly, bursts of pHLuorin-CD63 closely preceded adhesion formation. Analysis of these data revealed that 93% of adhesions were preceded by a burst of CD63-pHLuorin, with a median of 2 min lag between CD63 appearance and adhesion formation (Fig. 7b,c)\n",
      "To specifically test the role of exosome secretion in adhesion formation, we analysed the dynamics of adhesions in GFP-paxillin-expressing control and Rab27a-KD cells. Confocal movies taken in actively spreading cells revealed that Rab27a-KD cells have a selective defect in the rate of adhesion assembly (Fig. 7d,e and Supplementary Movie 9). There was no difference in the rate of adhesion disassembly (Fig. 7f) or in the overall number of peripheral adhesions per frame of the movies (25.16±4.37 for HT1080Scrambled, 27.65±3.08 (P=0.3229 compared with scrambled) for HT1080Rab27aKD1 and 30.40±4.24 (P=0.2112 compared with scrambled) for HT1080Rab27aKD2, P by Student's t-test). Overall, the slow adhesion assembly time led to a significant prolongation of the overall adhesion lifetime (average lifetime t1/2 for HT1080Scrambled adhesions=7.0±0.4 min, compared with HT1080Rab27aKD1=10.7±0.8 min (P<0.002, Student's t-test) and HT1080Rab27aKD2=10.4±1.0 min (P<0.002, Student's t-test). These data are consistent with the known relationship between dynamic adhesions and fast migration speeds323334\n",
      "FN is targeted to exosomes by interactions with integrins\n",
      "Our data indicate that FN becomes specifically targeted to exosomes in a form that promotes efficient adhesion formation. Soluble FN becomes converted to a fibrillar, adhesion-promoting form in association with cellular integrin receptors35, which are also frequent exosome cargos. To test whether targeting of FN to secreted exosomes depends on binding to integrins, we inhibited FN–integrin interactions and assessed the resulting FN content of exosomes. Treatment of HT1080 cells with integrin-binding RGD peptide for 48 h greatly decreased the FN content of exosomes compared with cells treated with control RGE peptide (Fig. 7g). Likewise, inhibition of the FN-binding integrin α5β1 by KD of α5 also decreased the FN content of exosomes (Fig. 7g). These data indicate that FN is targeted to exosomes by binding to cognate cellular integrin receptors, and then secreted in adhesive form to promote adhesion formation and effective cell motility\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "Cell movement through tissues is a complex process that requires a coherent response to potentially divergent tissue cues. Here we identify exosome secretion as a key autocrine mechanism to reinforce directional cues and support productive migration (see model in Fig. 8). In vivo, inhibition of exosome formation, MVE docking or MVE fusion led to similar defects in cell migration speed and persistence. In vitro, purified exosomes, but not shed microvesicles, were able to rescue speed defects of exosome-inhibited cells. Both in vitro and in vivo, secretion of exosomes stabilizes nascent protrusions, a phenotype associated with cellular adhesion192021. In vitro live-imaging experiments further demonstrated that a key function of exosomes is to promote adhesion assembly. A critical exosome cargo that drives the adhesion and speed of migrating cells is ECM, as demonstrated by the reduction in speed supported by FN-depleted exosomes and full rescue of speed defects in exosome-inhibited cells by purified FN. Altogether, our results demonstrate that autocrine exosome secretion promotes both efficient and directional cell motility and indicates that a major function of ECM in exosomes is to promote adhesion formation and enhance cell speed\n",
      "While exosomes have been implicated in cell motility previously141526, it has not been clear how essential to the process they are or what specific steps are regulated. Our data now demonstrate that autocrine secretion of exosomes controls both directional persistence and speed of cells migrating in vivo. To understand in depth the role of exosome-delivered ECM in cell motility, we carried out a variety of live-imaging experiments to both visualize the spatiotemporal relationship between exosome secretion and motility structure formation and demonstrate specific defects of exosome-inhibited cells in adhesion assembly and cell speed but not in protrusion formation. Altogether, these data reveal a much more important role for exosome secretion in adhesion formation than previously appreciated3637, and particularly highlight the key role of autocrine exosome secretion in motility processes\n",
      "A key question raised by our findings is why does the cell need to place FN on the outside of an exosome to promote adhesion assembly? FN is initially secreted from Golgi-derived vesicles in a soluble non-adhesion-promoting form and then assembled into fibres through interaction with integrins on the cell surface35. These fibres may not be optimally positioned to promote migration in one direction and their assembly may not be dynamic enough to respond to fluctuating directional cues. By contrast, endocytosis and resecretion of FN–integrin complexes on exosomes likely facilitates dynamic placement of highly competent adhesive substrata that promote cellular motility. In a previous study, we found that resecretion of fluorescent FN at the bottom of cells occurred within 1 h of its addition to the culture medium and was rapidly incorporated into nascent streak-like adhesion structures9. Presumably this endocytosis–resecretion process is happening continuously so that at any given time there may be a pool of matrix-carrying exosomes in MVE that could be rapidly secreted and used for migration\n",
      "FN is known to be endocytosed in association with integrins and targeted to MVE8 (Fig. 7g). During the intraluminal vesiculation process that creates exosomes within the MVE, the FN would be placed on the outside of the exosome (Supplementary Fig. 2) bound to integrins in the correct topology to interact with both the outside of the cell and with other ECM such as the collagen fibres in the chick CAM (see model, Fig. 8). In vitro, the major source of FN is serum. In the tumour microenvironment, the potential sources of soluble FN are many, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells and tumour cells, as well as leakage from the vasculature. It is also likely that additional matrix molecules could play a similar role, depending on the receptor profile of the migrating cells. In addition, matrix proteolysis could liberate adhesive fragments that could be internalized and then recycled on the outside of exosomes to promote dynamic adhesion formation and motility\n",
      "In addition to ECM, exosomes contain numerous cargoes that could impact cell motility in diverse contexts, including proteinases, growth, chemotactic and other extracellular factors23262738. Indeed, our in vivo data indicate that exosomes not only regulate cell speed but also directionality. Because Rab27a-KD cells did not have a defect in persistence in our random motility in vitro assays, we were not able to address exosome control of directionality in that experimental set-up. One possibility is that proteinases could facilitate persistent movement through tissues by remodelling impeding ECM. Another possibility is that exosomes mediate directional movement via chemokines or other factors. Specific identification of which exosome cargoes affect distinct aspects of cell motility is an important future area of research for both the exosome and motility fields. In addition, juxtaposition of multiple motility-promoting factors in a single exosome or closely apposed exosomes could synergistically modulate complex motility behaviours. Understanding these multivariate interactions will be an ongoing challenge for the field\n",
      "Use of the pHLuorin-CD63 probe to observe only extracellular CD63 allowed us to achieve a strong signal-to-noise ratio and observe dynamic relationships between exosome secretion and cellular structures. Our observation of adhesive trails left behind migrating cells is reminiscent of slime trails left by lower organisms, including snails, slugs and slime moulds394041. Such slime trails contain complex mixtures of components and serve a variety of purposes, including providing adhesive traction without gluing the organism in place3940, and, in the case of slime moulds, as a chemorepellant to prevent recrossing of the same track41. We speculate that trails of exosomes from mammalian cells may provide a similar mixture of functions, including not only adhesion but also the ability to modulate other cellular behaviours via diverse cargo molecules\n",
      "In this study, we identified a specific cellular organelle, the MVE, as critical to directional cell motility. As polarization is an intrinsic part of directional movement, this finding is consistent with recent findings that targeted MVE secretion is important for formation of the posterior pole of polarized Dictyostelia42. In addition, a recent study found that fibroblast-induced exosomes could mobilize Wnt11 from breast cancer cells to induce planar cell polarity signalling27. Interestingly, several molecules that have been previously shown to promote directional cell motility are sorted into exosomes and/or regulate their cargo content. Thus, syndecans were recently shown to control exosome biogenesis43 and also separately to control directional migration1. Likewise, Wnt molecules are major components of exosomes44 and together with syndecan-4 regulate directional cell motility in vivo12745. On the basis of these studies and our findings, we speculate that a number of molecules known to control directional cell motility may be doing so via control of exosome biogenesis or cargo content, or as biological cargoes of exosomes\n",
      "In summary, we have shown that exosome secretion is essential for directional and efficient cell migration and enhances migration speed by delivering ECM to promote adhesion formation. These data identify a novel feedback pathway that enhances cell motility via local autocrine secretion\n",

GFP-paxillin in pRS vector32 and mCherry-CD63 in pLenti6 (ref. 23) were used to make stably expressing cell lines. Low-expressing cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and used for experiments. mCherry-paxillin was a gift from Donna Webb (Vanderbilt University). pHLuorin-CD63 was generated by PCR resulting in the insertion of pHLuorin (a gift from Dr Philippe Chavrier, Institut Curie) between amino acids 42 and 43 in extracellular domain 1 of human CD63 cDNA (a gift from Dr Gillian Griffiths, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research) and recombined into pcDNA3.1. mCherry-Rab5a Q79L was from Addgene. DyLight 550 (62262, Thermo Scientific) was used to label human plasma FN (33016-015, Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

      "The CAM model\n",
      "Use of the chick CAM to model the formation of metastatic colonies and primary tumours is described in detail elsewhere1718. In brief, fertilized eggs decanted into sterilized weigh boats were allowed to mature ex ovo for 9 days. GFP-expressing cells were injected either i.v. or within the CAM tissue on developmental day 10. At indicated times, the ex ovo chick embryos were placed in a custom intravital imaging chamber4647. Images of tumour cells in the CAM were acquired using a Lumar V12 fluorescence stereomicroscope (Zeiss) or an Olympus BX61 equipped with a digital camera controlled with Volocity image acquisition software (PerkinElmer)\n",
      "In vivo analysis of cell migration and protrusion dynamics\n",
      "GFP-expressing HT1080 cells (1 × 105) were injected i.v. into the CAM of ex ovo chicks on developmental day 10. At 24 h post injection, the ex ovo chicks were transferred to an intravital imaging chamber and placed under a fully automated temperature-controlled microscope (99 °F, BX61, Olympus18). Time-lapse migration movies were captured every 15 min for 16 h using × 10/0.40 UPlanSApo objective lens, whereas protrusion dynamics movies were captured at every 2 min for 1 h using × 20/0.70 W UApo/340 water objective lens. To analyse in vivo cell migration, the nuclear position of each cell was tracked and cell speed, displacement rate and persistence index were analysed using Volocity. For protrusion dynamics analysis, the aspect ratio was calculated using Fiji, the number of protrusions formed was counted manually and length and persistence of protrusions were measured using Metamorph software (Molecular Devices)\n",

For further purification of UC-exosomes, the discontinuous iodixanol gradient was prepared48. Solutions (40% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v) and 5% (w/v)) of iodixanol were made by diluting OptiPrep (60% (w/v) aqueous iodixanol, Axis-Shield PoC) with 0.25 M sucrose/10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 from the bottom to the top of a 14 × 89 mm polyallomer tube. UC-exosomes were added on a top of the gradient and continuous gradient was made through UC at 100,000g (24,000 r.p.m. in SW40 Ti rotor) for 18 h. Twelve fractions were collected and each fraction was diluted in PBS. Each fraction was pelleted through another round of ultracentrifugation at 100,000g for 3 h, washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. To deplete FN in exosomes, cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FN-depleted BGS9 for 10 days before collecting conditioned medium for exosome isolation. Exosomes were quantitated by NanoSight tracking analysis\n",

Trypsinized cells (3,000 in each well) were then cultured overnight on the coated plates before capturing and analysing time-lapse migration movies using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000E microscope equipped with a 37 °C chamber as previously described9. The nuclear position of each cell was tracked and cell speed and persistence index was calculated using Metamorph software. For in vitro migration with add-back of exosomes in the media, cells were allowed to adhere to tissue culture well plates for 5 h before changing the media to DMEM supplemented with 10% exosome-depleted BGS (prepared by ultracentrifugation for 12 h at 100,000g)± purified exosomes.

      "For both quantitated data and representative images from experiments, the n values and independent experiment numbers are listed in the figure legends. Imaging data were acquired from at least three independent experiments and multiple images or movies on multiple cells were captured. Cell numbers to be quantitated for motility experiments were determined by our experience and analyses were excluded only if there is an obvious reason for poor data, such as dead or sick-looking cells. For non-quantitated western blots (for example, checking knockdown), they were generally performed a single time. All data sets were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test in SPSS software (IBM). Non-parametric data groups were compared using the Mann–Whitney U-test and plotted as box and whiskers, in which the box indicates the 25–75th percentile and the whiskers indicate the 5–95th percentile, with the line indicating the median. Parametric data were compared using Student's t-test and plotted as mean±s.e. in bar graphs\n",

      "Figure 8 Proposed model for exosome control of directionally persistent in vivo cell migration\n",
      "(a) In the absence of exosome secretion, cells have unstable protrusions (blue arrows) and are unable to migrate effectively. (b) Secretion of exosomes (yellow) allows cells to effectively respond to directional cues by reinforcing nascent adhesions (orange) and stabilizing protrusions. (c) Positive feedback from exosomes promotes effective and directionally persistent motility, through adhesion enhancement and potentially additional unknown mechanisms. (d) ECM cargoes, such as FN, are carried on exosomes through a process involving endocytosis of ECM-integrin complexes, such as FN-α5β1, and subsequent sorting into MVEs. (e,f) Autocrine secretion of FN-coated exosomes at the leading edge may allow decoration of collagen fibrils with FN-bound exosomes that can then interact with cellular integrin receptors. Locally elevated concentration of FN-bound exosomes via secretion could facilitate integrin clustering and strong adhesion formation leading to accelerated migration. ECM carried on autocrine-secreted exosomes may be particularly effective at promoting cellular adhesion by matching matrix ligands to the adhesion receptor repertoire of the cell\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Phase 3 clinical trial results reveal that Qsymia is a clinically effective long-term treatment for obesity, but whether this treatment is cost-effective compared to a diet and lifestyle intervention has yet to be explored\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "To quantify the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia (phentermine and topiramate extended-release) for health-related quality of life improvements\n",
      "Study design and methods\n",
      "Estimates are based on cost and quality of life outcomes from a 56-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial undertaken in 93 health centers in the US. Participants were overweight and obese adults (aged 18–70 years) with a body-mass index of 27–45 kg/m2 and two or more comorbidities (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes or pre-diabetes or abdominal obesity). The intervention was diet and lifestyle advice plus the recommended dose of Qsymia (phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate 46.0 mg) vs. control, which included diet and lifestyle advice plus placebo. The study was from the payer perspective. Costs included the prescription cost, medication cost offsets and physician appointment costs. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained (QALYs). The main outcome measure was incremental cost per QALY gained of the intervention relative to control\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Our base-case model, in which participants take Qsymia for 1 year with benefits linearly decaying over the subsequent 2 years, generates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $48,340 per QALY gained. Using the base-case assumptions, probabilistic sensitivity analyses reveal that the ICER is below $50,000 per QALY in 54 % of simulations. However, results are highly dependent on the extent to which benefits are maintained post medication cessation. If benefits persist for only 1 year post cessation, the ICER increases to $74,480\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Although base-case results suggest that Qsymia is cost-effective, this result hinges on the time on Qsymia and the extent to which benefits are maintained post medication cessation. This should be an area of future research\n",

      "Given the obesity epidemic, decision makers are looking to identify cost-effective strategies to improve the health of their obese members.\t\n",
      "Few effective medical interventions for weight loss are available.\t\n",
      "These results show that, in addition to clinically significant weight loss, Qsymia generates improvements in quality of life and reductions in medication costs.\t\n",
      "If benefits persist beyond medication cessation, results suggest that Qsymia may be a cost-effective nonsurgical alternative for weight management.\t\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Obesity is a major risk factor for a number of adverse health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and cancer [1]. Further, worldwide obesity rates have more than doubled in the past 3 decades, such that excess weight is now the fifth leading risk for global deaths, accounting for roughly 2.8 million deaths each year [2]\n",
      "In addition to the health effects, obesity imposes significant external costs on society. For example, in the United States (US) alone, annual medical expenditures for treating obesity-related health conditions now exceed $147 billion per year, with roughly half of this total directly financed by Medicare and Medicaid [3]. Other research shows that an obese worker has annual direct and indirect costs that are between $1,143 (class I obese male) and $6,694 (class II obese female) greater than costs for their normal-weight counterparts, depending on gender and degree of excess weight [4]. Moreover, the indirect costs of obesity, which result from workloss due to absenteeism and presenteeism, exceed the direct medical costs\n",
      "Due to these impacts of obesity on society, there are significant health and economic benefits that could be accrued to individuals, governments, insurers, and employers through successful weight-loss initiatives. Typically, the first line of treatment for excess weight is lifestyle modification [5]. However, on average, lifestyle interventions generate only modest weight loss [6], and this weight loss is rarely maintained long term [7]. Bariatric (weight loss) surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity [8], but due to its high cost (at least $20 K for the surgery alone) and invasive nature, few obese individuals have opted for this strategy. Roughly 113,000 weight-loss surgeries are performed yearly in the US [9], and yet this number is dwarfed by the obese population—estimated to be over 80 million adults [10, 11]\n",
      "Until recently, pharmacologic interventions for addressing chronic weight management have been limited. The drug combination fenfluramine/phentermine, referred to as fen-phen, was the first commercially successful weight loss drug. Although it was highly effective, it was later shown to have potentially fatal side effects, which led to its withdrawal from the market in 1997 [12]. Over the next 15 years, only two weight-loss prescription medications were widely available on the US market, sibutramine (Meridia) and orlistat (Xenical). Sibutramine was subsequently pulled from the market due to increased risk of cardiovascular events [13]. Until 2012, only orlistat was available for chronic use, but the weight loss observed in clinical trials was only a few percentage points greater than that seen with a placebo, and is associated with gastrointestinal side effects that limit its appeal [14, 15]\n",
      "However, in 2012, the US FDA approved two new therapies for chronic weight management: Belviq (lorcaserin) and Qsymia (phentermine plus topiramate extended-release), to be used in combination with diet and exercise. In a 1-year clinical trial, Qsymia phentermine 7.5 and topiramate 46 mg (recommended dose per label) [16], in conjunction with diet and exercise, generated a clinically significant weight loss of 6.6 % of body weight relative to diet and exercise plus placebo [17]. Statistically significant improvements with the Qsymia recommended dose compared with placebo were also noted in blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, glycemic parameters, and inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, rates of discontinuation with Qsymia were lower than with placebo, suggesting Qsymia has a tolerable side-effect profile. A follow-up study showed that weight loss was maintained after 2 years [18]\n",
      "These results suggest that Qsymia is effective at inducing weight loss and improving risk factors associated with comorbidities. However, the incremental cost-effectiveness of Qsymia compared to diet and exercise alone remains unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the recommended dose of Qsymia from the payer perspective. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has maintained a policy of not considering cost-effectiveness in national coverage decisions [19, 20], private insurers and large employers do not face such a restriction and have relied on cost-effectiveness analyses to inform decision making. For example, UnitedHealth Group now provides coverage for health coaches at YMCAs to work with overweight patients at high risk for type 2 diabetes based on research showing that this approach is likely to be cost-effective [21]. Because of pressure to provide pharmacologic treatments for obesity as a covered benefit, some insurers/employers will be interested to know whether long-term treatment on Qsymia is likely to be cost-effective\n",
      "Methods\n",
      "Study Description\n",
      "This study utilized the effectiveness results from the CONQUER randomized controlled trial. A complete description of the trial is available elsewhere [17]. In brief, CONQUER was a 56-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 93 health centers in the USA to determine the effectiveness of Qsymia for weight loss and weight-related comorbidities. The trial was undertaken between November 1, 2007 and June 30, 2009. Adult participants were eligible if they were overweight or obese with a body-mass index (BMI) between 27 and 45 kg/m2 and at least two obesity related co-morbidities, including increased waist circumference, elevated blood pressure, elevated cholesterol or type 2 diabetes managed with lifestyle modification or metformin. For those with type 2 diabetes, no lower BMI limit was applicable. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria were previously published [17]\n",
      "Eligible participants were stratified by gender and diabetes status and then randomly assigned in a 2:1:2 ratio to the placebo arm, the phentermine 7.5 mg plus topiramate extended-release 46 mg arm (Qsymia recommended dose), and the phentermine 15 mg plus topiramate extended-release 92 mg arm (Qsymia top dose) for 56 weeks. All participants received recommended counseling for diet and lifestyle modification. Study visits occurred at baseline and weeks 2 and 4 during drug titration, and every 4 weeks thereafter\n",
      "Effectiveness\n",
      "Prior analyses [17] focused on quantifying the efficacy and safety of Qsymia doses. Co-primary end-points were mean weight loss from baseline and the percentage who achieved clinically significant weight loss, defined as 5 % or greater from baseline. We extended that analysis by computing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the recommended dose of Qsymia relative to placebo in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We focused on the incremental cost-effectiveness of the recommended dose as it is the most commonly prescribed dose of Qsymia [22]\n",
      "This analysis was conducted from the payer perspective, which included the direct cost of Qsymia (assuming no rebates, co-payments or deductibles) less cost offsets from reductions in concomitant medications. The primary cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) sample, which consisted of all participants who completed baseline measurements and surveys, were randomly assigned, took at least one dose of the study drug or placebo, and had one post-baseline bodyweight measurement. Completers included a subset of these individuals who completed the trial on the study drug or placebo and for whom the final end-point measurement was obtained within 7 days of the last dose (see the Electronic supplementary material, ESM)\n",
      "The primary measure of effectiveness was an imputed health-related quality of life (QoL) score which was derived from the Short Form-12 version 2 (SF-12v2) survey [23]. The SF-12v2 survey is a validated questionnaire used to assess participant physical and mental health. We calculated changes in the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scales based on the SF-12v2 survey. We used the Brazier and Roberts algorithm [24] to convert the SF-12v2 survey into a health-related QoL metric for each participant at baseline and at 7 and 12 months (where 0 = dead and 1.0 = best imaginable health state). This algorithm is widely used in cost-effectiveness analyses [25–28]. We then estimated the change in this metric over the trial duration, with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) for those with missing data. We employed a linear regression model with change in QoL as the dependent variable and treatment arm as the key outcome variable; sex and mean-centered baseline QoL were included as potential confounders. Analogous regressions were run for physical and mental health summary scores. All regression analyses were conducted using Stata 13.1 [29]\n",
      "As it is not known when the QoL benefits accrued during the trial, we assumed that 50 % of the full benefits accrue in the first year (i.e., they received 6 months of the benefit). We further assumed that the benefits linearly decayed after the medication was ceased. Our base case assumed that individuals were on Qsymia for 1 year, with benefits linearly decaying to zero 2 years post-drug cessation. In one-way sensitivity analyses, we assumed linear decays of 0, 1, and 3 years. We also modeled an additional scenario whereby patients remain on Qsymia for 2 years, with 50 % of the benefits in the first year and full benefits in the second year, which then linearly decline to zero in years three and four. The assumption of full benefits through year two is supported by a follow-up study of Qsymia which found that individuals who remained on Qsymia for 2 years maintained the weight loss [18]\n",
      "Costs\n",
      "Costs and potential cost offsets for this analysis were limited to direct costs of Qsymia, physician appointments, and any potential cost offsets from reducing medications for concomitant medications. Based on market prices (September 2013), the direct cost of the recommended dose of Qsymia is $5.12 per day [30]. Noting that a large percentage stopped taking their medication mid-trial (31 % in the Qsymia recommended dose compared to 43 % in placebo), costs were allocated to participants according to how long each remained on the medication during the first 52 weeks of the 56-week trial period. We then included costs for two physician visits that would be expected to occur in the first year that someone starts a prescription weight loss drug [31]\n",
      "Medication Cost Offsets\n",
      "We focused on cost offsets for medications used to treat dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes, as these medications are likely to be influenced by successful weight loss and were tracked as part of the CONQUER trial [17]. Participants reported daily prescription medication use (dosage and name of drug) at baseline and study conclusion. Using this information, daily medication costs were quantified by multiplying the usage data by unit costs for each of the reported medications. Unit costs were obtained from Medi-Span’s PriceRx database in January 2013. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) was used for branded medications, while the average WAC (AWAC) was used for unbranded generics. Participants with no utilization at baseline and 56 weeks were allocated a cost of zero dollars. Baseline carried forward was used for those missing costs at 56 weeks. We then computed the change in daily medication costs for each class of drug and for the three combined from baseline to 56 weeks. To identify the impact of Qsymia on daily medication costs, we ran the same regression as for QoL, using an ITT approach. Similar to QoL, we did not know the exact date that changes in medication occurred; therefore, we assumed that daily medication savings began at month six. In future years we assumed that all savings in concomitant medications accrue for the entire year if participants remained on Qsymia\n",
      "Incremental Cost-Effectiveness (ICER) Ratios\n",
      "We calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios by dividing the incremental costs of the intervention by the incremental benefits (QALYs). As noted above, our base case assumed individuals remained on the medication for 1 year and accrued benefits through year three. We also considered 2 years on Qsymia, with residual benefits accruing from years three through four. We applied a discount rate of 3.5 % for all out-year estimates\n",
      "Sensitivity Analysis\n",
      "Several sensitivity analyses were carried out. In one-way sensitivity analyses, key inputs were varied one at a time to simulate the impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Specifically, we assessed the impact of:Changing the duration of benefit decay post drug cessation from 2 years in the base case to either 0 (worst case), 1, or 3 years (best case),\n",
      "Two years on Qsymia, with 50 % of benefits in the first year and full benefits in the second year, linearly declining to zero in years three and four,\n",
      "Using the lower and upper 95 % confidence intervals of effectiveness as estimated using converted SF-12v2 data from the trial (results available in Table 1 of the ESM),\n",

      "Changing the discount rate from 3.5 to 1 % and 5 %, and\n",
      "Assuming no residual benefits (or costs) beyond the trial period\n",
      "Subsequently, we employed probabilistic sensitivity analyses on the base-case model and ran the model 1,000 times to assess the effect of uncertainty regarding the input parameters (input values and a description of the calculations performed are available in the ESM). We assumed a normal distribution for medication costs and for effectiveness, using the estimated mean and standard deviations from the trial data. Based on the results, we report the percentage of iterations that fall below the $50,000 per QALY threshold and the cost per QALY value which 95 % of the observations fall below\n",

      "Study Sample\n",
      "Participant demographics are presented in Table 1. At baseline, the majority of participants were female and the average age was 51 years. Concerning comorbidities, 53 % of participants had hypertension, 36 % had dyslipidemia, and 16 % of the placebo group and 13.7 % of the Qsymia group had type 2 diabetes. At baseline, average weight was roughly 103 kg and average BMI was 36.5 kg/m2. Daily medication expenses were on average $1.19 and $1.37 for hypertension, $1.21 and $1.38 for dyslipidemia, and $0.08 and $0.07 for type 2 diabetes for the placebo and Qsymia arms, respectively. In total, this amounted to an average $2.47 and $2.83 a day in medication expenses for these conditions for the placebo and Qsymia arms, respectively, at baseline.

On average, participants taking the Qsymia recommended dose had 6.7 kg greater weight loss than those on the placebo (p < 0.01) [17]. At baseline, there was no difference in average PCS and MCS between groups (Table 2). Over the 56 weeks, both groups saw improvements in PCS scores, yet the adjusted change in PCS was 2.28 points higher for the Qsymia recommended group compared to the placebo group (p < 0.01; Table 2). There were no significant treatment effects observed for MCS for either group. At baseline, using the Brazier and Roberts algorithm, the imputed QoL scores were 0.797 and 0.803 for the placebo and Qsymia arms, respectively. Largely due to improvements in PCS scores, both groups saw statistically significant improvements in QoL at 56 weeks, 0.009 and 0.027, respectively, resulting in an adjusted improvement of 0.021 for those on Qsymia recommended dose (p < 0.01; Table 2).Table 2 SF-12 Physical Health Summary Scores, Mental Health Summary Scores and quality of life for ITT, mean (SE)\n",

One-way sensitivity analyses reveal that the assumption of benefit persistence beyond trial cessation has the largest effect on the ICER. Assuming no residual benefit increases the ICER from $48,340 in the base case (2 years post cessation benefits) to $152,030, whereas allowing for 3 years of benefits post cessation decreases the ICER to $35,270. The ICER was also increased substantially by taking the lower confidence interval of effectiveness, to $96,040, or increasing the prescription costs by 25 % to $60,420 per QALY gained. Excluding the medication offset or changing the discount rate did not substantially change the ICER.

      "Considering the completers sample, the ICER compared to the placebo was $47,690 for the base case. Results for the ITT and completer samples were similar because the increased cost of the Qsymia recommended dose among completers was similar to the increased QoL benefits (compared to the ITT sample, costs for Qsymia were 17 % higher and QoL benefits were 15 % greater for completers). Detailed results for completers are available in the ESM\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "This paper presented the incremental cost-effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life year gained) of the recommended dose of Qsymia plus diet and exercise relative to diet and exercise alone (plus placebo). While there is no explicit threshold for what is cost-effective in the US, there are several thresholds frequently cited as indicative of good value for money. The most frequently cited threshold in the US is $50,000 per QALY [32]. NICE, the agency that makes coverage recommendations for the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, accepts as cost-effective those interventions with an ICER below £20,000 (US$32,000) per QALY, or £30,000 (US$48,000) per QALY with strong reasons (£1 = USD$1.61 [33]) [34]\n",
      "Our base case, which assumes individuals remain on the drug for 1 year and that benefits linearly decay to zero in the 2 years following drug cessation, produced an ICER for the Qsymia recommended dose of $48,340, with probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealing that 54 % of our base-case simulations were below $50,000. Assuming a post benefit decay of only 1 year increased the ICER to $74,480 per QALY gained. These results suggest that the Qsymia recommended dose plus diet and exercise may be cost-effective, depending on the time on Qsymia medication and whether QoL benefits persist 2 years beyond medication cessation\n",
      "This analysis is based solely on the extrapolation of within-trial results and an assumption as to how long QoL benefits would be sustained post treatment. Because the duration that QoL benefits persist beyond the cessation of Qsymia is currently unknown, we modeled sensitivity analyses ranging from no residual benefits to benefits linearly decaying to zero 3 years beyond medication cessation. Future research should explore the average time on Qsymia and the duration that weight loss and QoL benefits persist post Qsymia cessation using real-world data\n",
      "This analysis has several limitations. First, because we do not employ a disease progression model, we cannot model potential longer-term savings in QoL or mortality that may result from a lower likelihood of disease progression. Second, because the Qsymia trial did not collect data on healthcare utilization, aside from select medications, our cost offset analysis is limited to reductions in the usage and cost of these medications. Further, there was no significant difference in daily medication costs between the placebo group and Qsymia recommended dose at trial cessation. Given the lower medication cost at baseline for the placebo arm, it is possible that the comparative reduction in medication costs for Qsymia may reflect a regression to the mean. However, it is also possible that incorporating additional longer-term benefits and/or cost offsets would suggest even greater cost-effectiveness results than those reported here. Third, due to the trial design, we were limited to modeling one dosage for the entire trial period, as opposed to following clinician guidelines for dose titration and stoppage rules. The FDA recommends that patients should start on Qsymia 3.75 mg/23 mg daily for 14 days, then increase to Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg daily (recommended dose) for 12 weeks. If 3 % weight loss is not achieved after 12 weeks on Qsymia 7.5 mg/46 mg dose, then it should be discontinued or escalated to Qsymia 11.25/69 for 14 days and then Qsymia 15/92 for 12 weeks. If 5 % weight loss is not achieved after 12 weeks on the Qsymia 15/92 dose, therapy should be discontinued as described in the label [16]. Whether or not this recommendation is followed is unclear, but the 2013 data indicate that roughly 35 % of the volume of Qsymia is from the Qsymia 3.75/23 dose, 56 % from the Qsymia 7.5/46 dose, and only 9 % from the Qsymia 11.25/69 and Qsymia 15/92 doses [22]. Due to the trial design, it is not possible to analyze the effects of titration. We chose to conduct the cost-effectiveness analysis focusing on the Qsymia 7.5/46 daily dosage, herein described as the recommended dose, because in practice few patients titrate to a higher dose after the run-in period. Finally, although our base-case results are based on LOCF, subsequent analyses using baseline carry forward and multiple imputation (MI) had almost no impact on the results; QoL estimates were identical to the fourth decimal in each case\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Given the health and cost consequences of obesity, payers are looking to identify cost-effective treatments. These results reveal that Qsymia may be cost-effective for overweight and obese individuals with two or more co-morbidities if individuals remain on the drug for extended periods and if QoL benefits are maintained post medication cessation. Quantifying these outcomes using real-world data should be an area of future research\n",

We developed an NF-κB functional assay in yeast to investigate the following issues: transactivation specificity of NF-κB proteins acting as homodimers or heterodimers; correlation between transactivation capacity and in vitro DNA binding measurements; impact of co-expressed interacting proteins or of small molecule inhibitors on NF-κB-dependent transactivation. Full-length p65 and p50 cDNAs were cloned into centromeric expression vectors under inducible GAL1 promoter in order to vary their expression levels. Since p50 lacks a transactivation domain (TAD), a chimeric construct containing the TAD derived from p65 was also generated (p50TAD) to address its binding and transactivation potential. The p50TAD and p65 had distinct transactivation specificities towards seventeen different κB response elements (κB-REs) where single nucleotide changes could greatly impact transactivation. For four κB-REs, results in yeast were predictive of transactivation potential measured in the human MCF7 cell lines treated with the NF-κB activator TNFα. Transactivation results in yeast correlated only partially with in vitro measured DNA binding affinities, suggesting that features other than strength of interaction with naked DNA affect transactivation, although factors such as chromatin context are kept constant in our isogenic yeast assay. The small molecules BAY11-7082 and ethyl-pyruvate as well as expressed IkBα protein acted as NF-κB inhibitors in yeast, more strongly towards p65. Thus, the yeast-based system can recapitulate NF-κB features found in human cells, thereby providing opportunities to address various NF-κB functions, interactions and chemical modulators\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a ubiquitously expressed family of transcription factors (TFs) that have critical roles in inflammation, immunity, cell proliferation, differentiation and survival [1]. Constitutive activation of these proteins is related to tumor prevalence and various diseases such as arthritis, immunodeficiency and autoimmunity [2]. These proteins are included in the category of rapidly acting, sequence-specific TFs that are present as inactive proteins in the cell and do not require new protein synthesis for activation. The activities of NF-κB proteins are tightly regulated at multiple levels and are influenced by several types of external stimuli as well as internal regulators [3,4]. Among the latter group, the IκB (Inhibitor of NF-κB) family of proteins is prominent among negative regulators of NF-κB activity. IκB associates with NF-κB through noncovalent, stable interactions forming NF-κB/IκB complexes. This interaction masks NF-κB nuclear localization signals, thereby inhibiting NF-κB translocation into the nucleus [5]. External stimuli such as IL-1 (interleukin-1), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α) and LPS (bacterial lipopolysaccharide) lead to phosphorylation of IκB by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex protein and subsequently enable nuclear translocation of NF-κB and transcription of the target genes [6,7]. Various pharmacological inhibitors act as direct or indirect inhibitors of NF-κB activity in vitro or in mammalian systems. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) directly inhibits NF-κB transactivation by targeting the DNA binding ability of p65 [8]. The small molecule BAY 11–7082 (BAY) has an indirect effect on NF-κB by inhibiting the IκB kinase (IKK) [9,10] or suppressing its activation [11]\n",
      "The NF-κB family can be divided into two subfamilies: type I (NF-κB1/p50 and NF-κB2/p52) and type II (p65/RELA, RELB and C-Rel). Structurally, the conserved N-terminal region of NF-κB proteins share a sequence homology across all the subunits that is termed Rel Homology Domain (RHD) [12,13] and is responsible for subunit dimerization, sequence-specific DNA binding and nuclear localization. The carboxy-terminal region comprises the transactivation domain (TAD) but is absent in p50 and p52 subunits. These two TAD deficient subunits can activate transcription only when they form heterodimers with a type II subunit or as homodimers in complex with other co-factors. Therefore, NF-κB dimers composed only of p50 and/or p52 subunits fail to activate transcription. The five NF-κB subunits can combine in pairs to produce up to 15 distinct functional NF-κB dimers [14]. Nevertheless, the physiological existence and relevance of all 15 dimers is not completely understood. The p50/p65 heterodimer is the most prevalent and well-studied NF-κB family dimer [14]. The p50 subunit can contribute to p65-mediated transcription, while p50 homodimers may have a repressive effect on NF-κB target gene expression [15]. Some of the NF-κB dimers are rarely observed in vivo such as p65/RelB and c-Rel/RelB [16]\n",
      "NF-κB homo- or hetero-dimers target a loose consensus sequence of 9–11 base pairs embedded in promoter or enhancer regions of target genes, referred to as κB binding site or κB Response Element (κB-RE). The general motif of this consensus sequence is 5’-GGGRNWYYCC-3’ (R = purine, N = any nucleotide, W = adenine or thymine, and Y = pyrimidine) [13]. Each NF-κB monomer occupies half of the κB-RE. NF-κB homo or heterodimers exhibit distinct DNA binding preferences towards specific κB-REs. The optimal DNA binding motifs for p50 and p65 homodimers based on in vitro selection are GGGGATYCCC and GGGRNTTTCC, respectively [17]. Distinct physical contacts along the 10-base-pair κB RE by NF-κB p50 homodimer or p65 homodimer have been identified through crystal structure analyses [18],[19]. The exact nature and mechanism of interactions between NF-κB and κB-RE sequences responsible for changes in transactivation specificities are not clearly understood. A single nucleotide change within κB-RE sequences can dramatically alter binding affinity, thereby impacting NF-κB-dependent target gene expression [20,21]. In a previous study, the transactivation potential of a κB-RE was revealed to be strongly influenced by the central base pair, which also impacts recruitment of p52 and p65 homodimers [22]. It has been proposed that NF-κB family transactivation specificity is not uniquely coded in the κB-RE sequence, suggesting participation of other cofactors in subunit specificity at NF-κB target gene promoters [23]\n",
      "To investigate the role of κB-RE sequences in mediating transactivation specificity in the absence of other endogenous regulatory regions that might influence κB-RE and NF-κB dynamics, we developed a versatile yeast-based NF-κB functional assay inspired by our previous work on the p53 family of transcription factors [24–26]. Since p50/p65 heterodimer is the most prevalent and well-studied dimer member of NF-κB family, we focused our attention on these proteins. Using several κB-REs selected from endogenous target sites, or differing by single nucleotide substitutions, we have employed in vivo quantitative analysis to address a) transactivation specificity of NF-κB proteins acting as homodimers or heterodimers; b) correlation between transactivation capacity and DNA binding measurements in vitro; c) impact of protein interactors, namely IκBα; and d) impact of small-molecule inhibitors on transactivation by NF-κB proteins\n",

      "Construction of yeast reporter strains containing κB-REs regulating the expression of the Firefly cDNA\n",
      "A panel of isogenic yeast reporter strain containing different version of single copies of the decameric κB-RE sequences, or two copies in tandem was constructed using single strand targeting oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG Operon, Ebersberg, Germany), at the chromosomal XV locus containing a minimal CYC1 promoter driving the expression of the Firefly luciferase cDNA. These experiments were developed following a previously published approach [24,25] that is an adaptation of the “delitto perfetto” approach to in-vivo site-directed mutagenesis [27,28] and starts with the yLFM-ICORE strain [25,29–31]. The protocol utilizes single-strand oligonucleotides that contain a desired κB-RE and exploits a triple-marker cassette positioned in the yLFM-ICORE strain near the CYC1 promoter. The cassette contains a counter-selectable gene (URA3), a reporter gene (kanMX4), and the I-SceI homing endonuclease along with its unique 18nt recognition site. The latter gene allowed us to engineer a unique double-strand break at the site where the cassette is cloned, which in turn leads to high efficiency oligonucleotide targeting via homologous recombination mediated by short (30nt) homology tails in the oligonucleotide sequence. These tails correspond to the sequence flanking the I-SceI target site placed on the chromosome, while the desired κB-RE sequence is at the center of the oligonucleotide sequence. Oligonucleotide targeting events were selected exploiting the counter-selectable and reporter markers of the ICORE cassette and correct reporter strains’ construction was confirmed by colony PCR across the engineered chromosomal region, followed by DNA direct sequencing (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy)\n",
      "Construction of p65 and p50 inducible yeast expression vectors\n",
      "Inducible expression in yeast of NF-κB family proteins was achieved with a GAL1-10 promoter using either a pTSG- (TRP1) or a pLSG- based (LEU2) vector [24,30]. Cloned sources of NF-κB protein cDNAs were a generous gift from Dr. Michael Karin (University of California at San Diego). Plasmid construction was achieved by standard restriction/ligation approaches and clones obtained upon transformation of competent E. coli cells were checked by DNA sequencing (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy). In the case of p50 and RelB, chimeric constructs were also constructed by fusing the region from p65/RelA corresponding to amino acids 302–549 and containing the transactivation domain, to the C-terminal end of either coding sequences, removing the stop codon. These chimeras were obtained by a PCR-based approach using specific primers amplifying the chosen portion of the p65/RelA cDNA and containing homology tails for a gap-repair approach in yeast [32]. The PCR amplicon was then co-transformed together with the pTSG-p65 or pTSG-RelB plasmids linearized using the SalI or NotI enzymes that are present downstream to the cloned cDNA stop codon. Transformants of this gap-repair assay were cultured to extract genomic and plasmid DNA and then used to transform E. coli competent cells to prepare plasmid DNAs that were then checked by restriction digestion and confirmed by DNA sequencing (BMR Genomics). The resulting plasmids were named pTSG-p50TAD and pTSG-RelBTAD. The latter was however inactive in the yeast-based transactivation assays (data not shown). Plasmid pLSG-p50TAD was constructed starting from pTSG-p50TAD (originally derived from pRS314) and pRS315 [33] swapping the portion of the vector containing the selection marker by PvuI restriction and ligation\n",
      "IκBα cDNA cloning into an ADH1-based yeast expression vector\n",
      "Using a designed set of primers containing flanking 5’ and 3’ homology tails for the ADH1 promoter region and a cyc1-derived terminator sequence, we amplified the human IκBα coding sequence (953 bp) from cDNA obtained from total RNA extraction of human MCF-7 cells to obtain a PCR amplicon that could be used in a gap repair experiment. As receiving vector for this recombination-based cloning we used the centromeric pRS315-derived pLS-Ad vector [24], containing the LEU2 selectable marker, the constitutive ADH1 (alcohol dehydrogenase 1 gene) promoter for expressing cDNA of interest and a terminator sequence from the CYC1 gene to facilitate transcriptional termination. The pLS-Ad was digested with XhoI and SalI and co-transformed in yeast together with the PCR product using the lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol [34]. Transformants were selected on plates lacking leucine (referred to as SDlA). Randomly selected colonies from SDlA plates were used to recover the expected recombinant plasmid through yeast total DNA extraction protocol, transformation into DH5alpha E. coli competent cells, subsequent DNA extraction (Qiagen, Milan, Italy), followed by digestion with restriction enzymes to select positive clones, which were further verified by DNA sequencing (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy). Co-transformants (LiAc protocol) of the correct IκB vector clone (LEU2 marked) with an NF-κB expression vector (TRP1 marked) into yLFM-M2 reporter strain were selected on double drop-out plates lacking leucine and tryptophan and containing a high amount of adenine The empty vector pRS315 was co-transformed along with each of the NF-κB expression vectors or with pRS314 to generate an appropriate control\n",
      "Yeast-based Luciferase assays\n",
      "The newly constructed yLFM-κB-RE strains were transformed with the NF-κB expression vectors. Transformants were then processed for the miniaturized protocol of the luciferase assay we recently developed [24]. Briefly, transformant colonies kept on selective glucose plates were grown for 16 hours, unless otherwise stated, in synthetic liquid media containing raffinose (2%) with or without different concentrations of galactose, which serves as inducer of the GAL1 promoter driving the expression of the NF-κB proteins. Luciferase activity was measured using the Bright Glo Luciferase assay kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) and expressed either as relative light units (RLU) normalized to optical density (600 nm), subtracting the luminescence obtained by the cells transformed with the empty vector in each reporter strain, or as fold-induction over the empty vector. Experiments included four biological repeats and the results were plotted as mean values and the standard errors of the mean\n",
      "Gene reporter assays in MCF7 cells\n",
      "Four κB-REs were tested in the human MCF7 cell line. Two copies of the decameric motif were cloned in direct orientation upstream of Firefly luciferase gene within the pGL4.26 vector (Promega), using a pair of complementary oligonucleotides ligated into KpnI/XhoI double-digested plasmid. A unique NdeI restriction site was included 5’ to the κB-REs to facilitate the identification of ligation products. Plasmids were purified and sequenced across the modified region. For gene reporter assays, MCF7 cells were transiently transfected at ~80% confluence using FugeneHD (Promega) with the newly constructed pGL4.26 reporters and the pRL-SV40 control luciferase vector. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with the immune-cytokine TNFα (either 10ng/ml or 50ng/ml). When needed, the IKK inhibitor BAY11-7082 was added at the final concentration of 20μM for a total of 8 hours. Dual luciferase assays were performed 4 hours or 8 hours after TNFα treatment, following the manufacturer’s protocol\n",
      "Western Blot assays in yeast and human cells\n",
      "Yeast transformants were grown for 16 hours in selective medium containing the indicated amounts of galactose to induce the expression of NF-κB cDNAs from the GAL1-based vectors. An equivalent amount of cells, based on the culture absorbance measurement (corresponding to 2.5 OD measured at OD600nm), was collected by centrifugation. Cells were processed following extraction protocols described previously [35,36] and 15 μl of extracts were loaded on 12% poly-acrylamide gels. Transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes was achieved using the i-Blot semi-dry system (InVitrogen, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy). Specific antibodies directed against p65/RelA TAD domain (clone C-20 Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Milan, Italy) or p53 (clone DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were diluted in 1% non-fat skim milk dissolved in PBS-T. PGK1 (Phospho Glycerate Kinase 1) was used as a loading control and immune-detected with a monoclonal antibody (clone 22C5D8, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein lysates from human MCF7 cells were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Thermo Fisher, Monza, MB, Italy) and quantified using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher). 20 μg of proteins were loaded onto 12% poly-acrylamide gels. p65 (clone C-20), p50 (clone H119, Santa Cruz), GAPDH (cytoplasmic markers; clone 6C5, Santa Cruz) and Histone 3 (nuclear marker, Ab1791, Abcam) were probed. Immuno-reactive bands were detected using the ECL Select reagent (Amersham, GE Health Care, Milan, Italy) and the ChemiDoc XRS+ documentation system through the ImageLab software (BioRad, Milan, Italy)\n",
      "Results\n",
      "Development of p65 and p50 expression vectors and reporter yeast strains\n",
      "We cloned full-length human p65 and p50 cDNAs under the control of the GAL1 promoter in a centromeric yeast expression vector. This promoter was chosen as it enables a wide variation in protein expression in cells cultured in medium containing raffinose (the carbon source) supplemented with various amounts of galactose to induce GAL1 transcription [37]. We were confident that p65 could act as a sequence-specific TF in yeast based on a previous report [38] and on the fact that the protein contains a transactivation domain of the acidic class that is reported to be proficient in contacting the yeast transcriptional machinery [39]. However, given that p50 does not contain a transactivation domain, we also generated a chimeric p50-referred to as p50TAD- where the transactivation domain of p65 was fused to the carboxy-terminus of the p50 coding sequence. This provided a unique opportunity for an in vivo functional assessment of p50 DNA binding specificity\n",
      "To develop isogenic κB reporter strains, we took advantage of the delitto perfetto based protocol [24,28] for in vivo targeting κB-REs to a chromosomal locus containing a minimal promoter placed upstream of the Firefly luciferase gene [24,28]. The protocol is described in the Material and Methods. Seventeen κB-REs were chosen to sample a wide range of DNA binding affinities that had previously been measured by in vitro gel shift assays (see sequences in Table A in S1 File) [21]. The seventeen yeast reporter strains were transformed with p65 or p50 expression vectors and luciferase assays were developed following a miniaturized protocol we previously established for the p53 family of transcription factors [24]\n",
      "p65 and p50TAD exhibited differences in relative transactivation capacity and specificity\n",
      "Presented in Fig 1A are the results of transactivation at the seventeen REs following moderate levels of induction of p65 or p50TAD (0.032% gal, as described in Fig 1D). p50TAD activated transcription of eight of the seventeen REs (Fig 1A). This result establishes that p50 can establish specific interactions with target κB-RE sequences when expressed in yeast. p65 was active towards ten κB-REs, but the relative transactivation potentials and pattern of specificities differed remarkably from that of p50TAD (Fig 1A). Five κB-REs were inactive both with p65 and p50TAD. One RE (LIF) was specifically responsive to p50TAD, while three (RANTES, RE2, M1) were selectively responsive to p65. Some of the κB-REs are named from the corresponding human NF-κB target genes. However, in our assay only the decameric κB motif is studied\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pone.0130170.g001Fig 1 Relative transactivation potential of p50 and p65 homodimers towards a panel of κB Response Elements\n",
      "A) κB target site preferences of p50TAD and p65 homodimers. Luciferase assays were performed to quantify relative transactivation capacity of p50TAD and p65 homodimers towards 17 different κB-REs. Reporter strains were grown in selective media containing 0.032% galactose for 16 hours reaching near stationary phase. For each isogenic reporter strain, the luciferase activity is calculated as fold-induction with respect to the values obtained with empty vector transformants. The average normalized activity and the standard error of four biological repeats are presented. κB-REs are ranked based on increasing transactivation potential with p50TAD. The same rank is used to plot the results obtained with p65 (lower panel). To the right are presented κB-RE sequences that are selectively responsive to either p50TAD or p65 (see text for sequence match to optimized consensus for p50 or p65). B, C) Web logo representations of the groups of κB-REs that were active or inactive with p50TAD and p65, respectively. D) Western blots presenting the relative expression of p50TAD and p65 proteins at different amounts of galactose. Yeast cells transformed with the GAL1-based expression vectors for NF-κB proteins were cultured for 16 hours at the indicated concentrations of galactose. An antibody directed against the p65 transactivation domain, which is also present in the p50TAD construct, was used for immunodetection. PGK1 endogenous protein provides a loading control\n",
      "Consensus sequences generated using the web logo tool with the transactivation-proficient and deficient κB—REs revealed that mismatches at positions 6 but, surprisingly, also changes at the supposedly permissive position 5 of the decameric G1G2G3R4N5W6Y7Y8C9C10 κB—RE impaired transactivation by both proteins (Fig 1B and 1C). Moreover, p50TAD showed a preference for an A in position 5, while a T at position 8 also negatively impacted transactivation. Taken collectively, the results were in agreement with reported differences in p50 and p65 optimal binding sites determined by SELEX [40]. Overall, p65 was a stronger transcription factor compared to p50TAD (both were expressed at similar levels; Fig 1D)\n",
      "Both p50TAD and p65 exhibited weak transactivation cooperativity from adjacent κB-REs\n",
      "Having established that both p65 and the chimeric p50TAD could act as sequence specific TFs in yeast, we explored whether two adjacent κB-REs could lead to synergistic induction of transactivation. Some natural NF-κB target sites contain pairs of κB-REs, whose sequence features can impact on gene transcription [20]. Functional interactions between nearby κB-RE sites have been reported [22] and the potential for cooperative interactions between NF-κB proteins at clustered binding sites has been inferred [41], but not directly addressed under a defined experimental system. The experiments were performed using two different amounts of galactose to titrate the transactivation response. The M2 and I1 REs, which were highly responsive to p65 and moderately responsive to p50TAD, were chosen. Reporter strains containing two adjacent RE copies had an additive effect when analyzed with p50TAD for both κB-REs. A higher amount of galactose (0.1%) did not lead to higher transactivation levels with p50TAD, suggesting that the maximal level of responsiveness for these strains was reached at 0.032% galactose. Instead, p65 showed a galactose-dependent transactivation ability and mainly additive effects for one vs two REs number, with the exception of the M2 RE at the lower galactose concentration (Fig 2A). We also tested RE6 and the combination of RE6 and RE1, which were inactive both with p65 and p50TAD when studied separately. Two copies of the non-responsive RE6 did not lead to any transactivation either with p50TAD or p65 even using very high expression levels (1% galactose) (Fig 2B). The same was true for the combination of RE6 and RE1 except for weak responsiveness to p65\n",

      "A) Yeast-based luciferase assays were performed at moderate to high expression levels of p50TAD or p65. Results were normalized and plotted as in Fig 1. The impact of tandem duplication (2d) of the decameric (1d) κB-RE or the indicated combination of two different κB-REs was evaluated. The REs were chosen based on the results from Fig 1 to include sequences exhibiting different levels of transactivation potentials. B) RE1 and RE6 were inactive as decameric κB-REs and there was no transactivation for two decamers in tandem or high expression of NF-κB proteins (up to 1% galactose). C) Functional interactions between two different κB-REs derived from the MCP-1 promoter. The M1 and M2 decameric κB-REs exhibited different responsiveness to p50TAD and p65, when examined separately, but are both derived from the MCP-1 promoter and they are located in close distance (19 nucleotide spacer) in the natural context. The combined responsiveness of the M1 and M2 κB-REs was examined, taking into account the impact of the distance between the two decamers and orientation relative to the transcriptional start site. Tandem repeats of M1 or M2 were included as controls. Yeast reporter strains, transformed with the indicated expression vector were cultured for 16 hrs with the indicated low amount of galactose. Relative activity refers to the average light units normalized for cell number (measured by optical density at 600nm). Average and standard error of four biological repeats are presented. The NF-κB-independent reporter activity (empty vector) is also presented as reference. Interestingly, the M2+M1 strains exhibited higher basal level of reporter expression. The M1+M2 sp strain contains the M1 and M2 κB decamers separated by 18 nt as in the human gene (see Table A in S1 File)\n",
      "Next, we investigated cis-based interactions among different κB-REs using those from the MCP1 promoter as an example. The responsiveness to NF-κB of this promoter in human cells is mediated by two closely-spaced REs (M1 and M2) that are separated by 19 nt and are located ~ -2.8kb from the transcriptional start site (TSS) [20,22]. As noted above, the M2 κB-RE was highly responsive to p65, while M1 exhibited lower responsiveness. On the contrary, the M1 κB-RE was not responsive to p50, while M2 was weakly responsive. We developed reporter strains containing combinations of M1 and M2 κB-REs, and also examined the impact of the 19nt spacer sequence between them as well as the effect of the relative positioning of the two κB-REs with respect to the promoter of the reporter and the TSS. Strains containing two copies of the M1 or M2 κB-REs were used as controls (Fig 2C)\n",
      "The non-responsiveness of the M1 RE to p50TAD was confirmed, even when two adjacent copies of this κB-RE are placed upstream the reporter cassette. The reporter strain containing both M1 and M2 showed responsiveness to p50TAD, similar to what was observed with the M2 strain, while the transactivation by p65 was intermediate between the M1 and M2 strains. The M1 κB-RE had a stronger negative impact towards p65 than p50TAD. The relative positioning of the M1 and M2 κB-REs relative to the TSS of the reporter gene did not affect the transactivation potential. Interestingly, the natural 19nt spacer between the M1 and M2 decamers did not impact the transactivation potential. Overall it appears that there is limited functional interaction between adjacent or closely spaced κB-REs for p50- or p65-dependent transactivation in yeast\n",
      "Co-expression of p50 and p65 leads to specific changes in relative transactivation\n",
      "Since p50 and p65 are normally present at the same time in mammalian cells and the p50/p65 heterodimer is considered a prominent functional complex in vivo, we examined p50 and p65 co-expression and transactivation towards the eight κB-REs described in Fig 3A and 3B. Both genes were expressed under the same GAL1 promoter on different single copy centromere plasmids. Experiments were performed at two levels of NF-κB protein expression where co-expression of p50TAD and p65 resulted in transactivation levels that were approximately an average of those seen with the expression of either protein, with the exception of the RelBCons κB-RE. The relative proportion of homodimers and heterodimers was not determined. In fact, p50TAD or p65 alone led to similar levels of RelBCons κB-RE transactivation but the reporter was much more responsive in the co-expression experiment. The strain with the I1 and I2 κB-REs exhibited similar responsiveness to both p50TAD and p65, but co-expression of these two proteins did not have an impact on the level of transactivation of this promoter. At higher levels of galactose (Fig 3B), the differences between expression of p65 alone or co-expression were lower, with the RelBCons strain maintaining high responsiveness when the two TFs were co-expressed. The experiment was performed also at different time points of NF-κB proteins induction with comparable results (Fig A in S1 File)\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pone.0130170.g003Fig 3 Functional interactions between p50 and p65 towards a panel of κB-REs\n",
      "A) and B) Eight different κB-REs, each comprising two adjacent copies of the decameric κB sequences were examined for the transactivation potentials of p50TAD, p65 as well as upon co-expression of both proteins. Cells were grown in lower (0.008%, panel A) and high (0.064%, panel B) levels of galactose. C) A non-chimeric p50 construct lacking the TAD domain was also studied at the higher galactose level for all REs, except RelBCons. In all panels, luciferase assays were conducted and results plotted as described in Fig 1\n",
      "We also examined the impact of full-length p50 without the chimeric TAD, expressed alone or combined with p65 protein (Fig 3C). As expected, given the lack of a TAD, p50 was inactive as a transcription factor. However, the presence of the full-length p50 actually led to inhibition of p65-dependent transactivation in the co-expression experiments, much more than could be simply accounted for by the anticipated amount of p50 homodimer. This inhibition could be due possibly to competition for the RE site by p50 homodimers, that can be proposed for the case of I2 or RE4 given the transactivation levels with p50TAD homodimers in those strains (see Fig 3B). For other REs, such as M1 and M2 that are weakly if at all responsive to p50TAD homodimers, it could be inferred that in the co-expression experiments, heterodimers would be preferentially formed and that the p65-p50 dimer would be a weaker transcription factor compared to p65-p50TAD\n",
      "The relative transactivation potentials of selected κB-REs is confirmed in MCF7 cells\n",
      "To examine whether the differences in transactivation capacity observed in yeast were predictive of variable responsiveness in mammalian cells upon NF-κB activation, κB-dependent gene reporter assays were carried out in the human MCF7 cells. We selected 4 different κB-REs whose transactivation potential driven by co-expressed p65 and p50TAD ranked from high (M2, RelBCons) to medium (RE4) and to low (M1) in yeast. Those κB-REs were placed upstream of the Firefly luciferase in the pGL4.26 vector for transient transfection experiments. Twenty-four hours post-transfection cells were treated with 10ng/ml (Fig 4A) or 50ng/ml (Fig 4B) TNFα and/or with 20μM BAY11-7082 (BAY) respectively to activate or repress the NF-κB pathway. Results demonstrated that differences in relative transactivation potential measured in yeast were confirmed in human cells. In fact the M2 κB-RE was the most responsive, followed by RelBCons, with M1 being the least responsive. Time- and concentration-dependent TNFα responsiveness and repression by BAY were apparent. TNFα treatment led to a strong increase in p65 protein in nuclear extracts, while the p50 protein was already nuclear in mock condition and its abundance did not change significantly after treatment (Fig 4C). This observation suggests that the increase in M2 κB-RE responsiveness observed already in mock condition might be dependent primarily on p50 homodimers, while the enhanced responsiveness after TNFα treatment would be related to the increase of p65 in the nucleus\n",

      "IκBα and the small molecules BAY 11–7082 and ethyl pyruvate inhibit NF-κB-dependent transactivation in yeast\n",
      "Having established that p65 and p50TAD can act as sequence-specific TFs alone or in combination, we asked whether the assay system could be used to monitor the impact of protein or small-molecule inhibitors. In mammalian cells the functions of the canonical NF-κB pathway are mainly regulated at the level of p65 subcellular localization [42]. In particular, IκBα can sequester p65 in the cytoplasm by masking the nuclear localization sequences thereby inhibiting its translocation into the nucleus [6,7]\n",
      "We cloned the human IκBα cDNA into a constitutive expression vector exploiting the ADH1 constitutive moderate promoter and the LEU2 selection marker. This enabled us to select double transformants. The M2 κB-RE, which was the most responsive to p65 and moderately responsive to p50TAD, was chosen for these experiments. There was a significant reduction in luciferase activity with p65-IκBα double transformant cells, compared to transformants with p65 alone (Fig 5A). Interestingly, there was no effect of IκBα on the basal, constitutive level of reporter expression or on the activity of the reporter dependent on p50TAD. Immunoblots indicated that in the presence of the IκBα expression plasmid, protein levels of both p50TAD and p65 from whole cell extracts were comparable or even higher (Fig 5B), suggesting that the impact of IκBα might actually be underestimated, and that IκBα might stabilize p50TAD and especially p65 proteins by forming stable complexes as reported for mammalian cells [43,44]\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pone.0130170.g005Fig 5 IκBα inhibits p65-dependent transactivation in yeastThe highly responsive M2 strain was used to test the impact of co-expressing IκBα with the NF-κB proteins p50TAD or p65. A) Luciferase assays results were obtained and plotted as described in Fig 1. Control transformants lacking the IκBα expression construct were obtained using the pRS315 empty vector. Cells were cultured in 0.032% galactose for 16 hours to achieve moderate expression of p50TAD or p65. IκBα is expressed under the constitutive ADH1 promoter. For all conditions the light units were normalize for the optical density of the cultures.

      "We also explored the use of the yeast-based assay for assessing the activity of known mammalian NF-κB inhibitors BAY [9,11,45], ethyl-pyruvate (EP) [8] and parthenolide [46]. Luciferase assays were conducted in M2, RE4 and RelBCons strains as they exhibited different relative responsiveness to either p50TAD or p65 alone or to their co-expression at a low level of galactose (0.008%) (Fig 5). BAY and EP treatments led to a dose-dependent inhibition of p65-mediated transactivation. The effect was less evident with p50TAD (Fig 6). Parthenolide had no impact on p65- or p50TAD-mediated transactivation (Fig B in S1 File). As controls, the effect of the molecules on the NF-κB-independent, basal expression of the reporter, or on the steady-state levels of p65 or p50TAD proteins was examined (Fig 6D and 6E). To test the generality of the EP effect, we examined its impact on p53-mediated transcription, considering that p53 is expressed in yeast from the same GAL1 promoter system used for NF-κB [15,30]. Unlike what was observed with p65 and p50TAD, p53 transactivation was unaffected by EP up to the 5mM dose and only slightly reduced at 10mM, while at the highest dose (20mM) it was completely inhibited. Further, no impact on p53 protein levels was seen after 2.5 or 5mM EP treatment (Fig C in S1 File). Overall, while at high doses, indirect effects could potentially bias the results, the yeast transactivation system provides a tool to study specific small molecule inhibitors of NF-κB transactivation\n",

      "Discussion\n",
      "Using a quantitative luciferase assay system, we investigated the role of κB-RE sequence in mediating NF-κB (p50 and p65) transactivation specificity. We devised a chimeric construct (p50TAD) that enabled investigations of relative transactivation specificities of p65 and p50 when expressed alone, and their functional interactions when co-expressed. We were unable to develop an equivalent assay for RelB, even though we developed a chimeric RelB-TAD construct with an equivalent approach to that used for p50 (data not shown). This lack of activity could be due to a lack of relevant cofactors in yeast or to an inability of RelB to be expressed at sufficient levels for transactivation in the yeast nucleus. Previous studies reported the development of a yeast-based assay to measure NF-κB dependent transactivation and had established that NF-κB proteins can act as sequence-specific transcription factors in yeast [38] [47]. However, our work has several unique features: variable expression of the transcription factors; creation of a chimeric, transactivation competent p50 construct; use of a chromosomally integrated reporter and a microplate format that was compatible with the analysis of small molecules potentially targeting NF-κB proteins\n",
      "p65 and p50TAD exhibited marked differences in transactivation specificity (Fig 1) and, although limited by the number of κB—REs examined, co-expression of p65 and p50TAD led to RE-selective changes in transactivation potential. Non-chimeric p50 was inactive as a transcription factor, as expected given its lack of a transactivation domain [42], but its co-expression with p65 led to strong inhibition of p65-dependent transactivation, suggesting that p50 homodimers can compete with p65 homodimers, although we cannot exclude that heterodimers containing only one transactivation domain would be inactive as a transcription factor in yeast. p65 was highly active towards 6 κB-REs, the highest being M2 (derived from the MCP-1 promoter) followed by I1 and RE4. All three contained the GGAA sequence, predicted to be a preferred binding motif (Table A in S1 File) [20,21]. Co-expression of p50TAD and p65 in yeast also demonstrated high activity with 4 κB-REs (M2, I1, RelBCons and RE4). p50TAD showed higher activity towards the RelBCons, RE5, I2 and RE4, all of which, except for I2, contained a GGGG sequence, reported to be a preferred binding motif\n",
      "We compared transactivation potentials with DNA binding affinities measured by in vitro gel shift assays [21] or by custom NF-κB protein binding microarray experiments and surface plasmon resonance analysis [48], as described in Fig 7. We also wanted to address various functional aspects of NF-κB target sequences, such as interactions between adjacent κB-REs and the impact of short spacers. Seventeen κB-REs were chosen for this analysis and the relative transactivation capacities were measured with p65 and p50TAD. These REs were chosen to represent a wide range of DNA binding affinities (~100-fold for p50), based on EMSA assays [21]. There were striking exceptions to an overall correlation trend between relative DNA binding affinity and relative transactivation potential both for p50 and p65+p50. For example, JunB and RE6 were extremely weak in transactivation assays but were reported to be bound with high affinity in vitro (Fig D in S1 File). The overall correlation was higher with DNA binding predictions based on protein-binding microarray experiments [48] that were obtained from an online tool (http://thebrain.bwh.harvard.edu/nfkb), particularly for p50/p65 heterodimers. There were however differences between the two parameters (e.g. LIF and RANTES for p50, RE2 and RE1 for p65) (Fig 7). These findings further validate our yeast-based approach. A recent study based on a largely unbiased ChIP-sequencing approach in mammalian cells confirmed that the central sequence motif of a κB-RE plays a critical role in deciding the transcriptional specificity by NF-κB proteins [22], emphasizing the significance of RE sequence even in an environment where additional cis-elements and trans-factors interplay to regulate transcription. Our data confirmed the impact that single nucleotide changes can have on transactivation potential (e.g. RE1 vs RE2, M1 vs M2) (Table A and Fig A in S1 File), consistent with previous reports in mammalian cells [20,21]. For example, a lentiviral-based approach demonstrated that differences in the nucleotide sequence of κB-REs embedded in about 5 kb of the MCP-1 promoter sequence could dictate the level of responsiveness to NF-κB activation by TNFα or LPS and the relative activity of different NF-κB family members [20]. In agreement with our observations in yeast, this study also established p65 as a major factor in MCP-1 promoter transactivation with a limited contribution from p50 and p52. Also, consistent with our results, the replacement of the κB-REs within MCP-1 with those present in the IP-10 promoter (I1 and I2) led to preferential responsiveness to p50 homo or hetero-dimers. However, the I1 κB-RE when tested separately exhibited a lower relative responsiveness to p50TAD in yeast\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pone.0130170.g007Fig 7 Comparison between predicted DNA binding affinity and yeast-based transactivation\n",
      "A), B) The relative binding affinities of p50 or p65 towards 17 κB-REs were obtained from (http://thebrain.bwh.harvard.edu/nfkb) and compared with the relative transactivation potential measured in yeast at moderate levels of galactose induction. REs are ordered from left to right based on increasing Z-score for DNA binding affinity. The highest affinity RE (RE5 for p50 and I1 for p65) is set to 100. REs with Z-score lower than 4, considered equivalent to background, are labeled by *. C) Similarly, Z-scores of the p50-p65 heterodimers and transactivation potentials are compared for the 6 κB-REs that were tested in the co-expression experiments in yeast\n",
      "To address the predictive value of the yeast-based assay for NF-κB-dependent transactivation in human cells expressing endogenous p65 and p50, four κB-REs were tested in gene reporter assays in MCF7 cells treated with TNFα. There was generally a good correspondence between transactivation potential in the two systems (Figs 1, 3 and 4)\n",
      "Clearly, κB-RE sequences can have a direct role in influencing transactivation specificity of NF-κB proteins in a manner that is not solely related to DNA binding affinity [49]. A lack of complete correlation between DNA binding affinity and transactivation potential was also observed for the p53 family of TFs in our previous studies [50,51]. For p53, cooperative interactions between adjacent REs and a role for RE structure and kinetic properties were recognized to contribute to transactivation, especially at low expression levels [37,52]. Even a single nucleotide spacer between two half-sites that constitute the canonical p53 RE has a negative impact on p53- and, particularly, p73-dependent transactivation [51,53,54], while a spacer between two full sites has less of an effect and a short spacer could be beneficial, potentially due to steric hindrance [51]\n",
      "Based on those results we studied interactions between adjacent or closely-spaced κB-REs and found somewhat more than additive, but not strong cooperative interactions between two adjacent identical κB binding half-sites. These results are consistent with a comprehensive recent study in mammalian cells that concluded that NF-κB acts non-cooperatively at closely-spaced binding sites to provide gradual increase in gene expression [41]\n",
      "We used the yeast-based assay to explore the possibility to monitor the impact of protein and small molecules inhibitors on transactivation potential and specificity of NF-κB proteins. Co-expression of IκBα, a well-known inhibitor of NF-κB, led to reduced transactivation by p65. This suggests that the assay can be exploited to study crosstalk between NF-κB and upstream regulators, consistent with a previous report [38]. Interestingly, the effect of IκBα towards p50TAD was much less evident, suggesting distinct thresholds for IκBα-dependent regulation of NF-κB members. Consistently, protein-protein interaction experiments on IκBα with NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimers revealed critical interactions between IκBα and p65 [43]. We also establish that the small molecule BAY-11-7082 causes a dose-dependent inhibition of p65 as well as p50TAD-dependent transactivation. BAY11-7082 is an inhibitor of the IKK kinase that in higher eukaryotes modulates the IκBα kinase IKK. However, this molecule was shown to inhibit a broad range of protein kinases including tyrosine phosphatases [11,45]. Three different κB-REs were examined for the effect of BAY treatment. p65 homodimers or p65 co-expressed with p50TAD appeared to be more sensitive to the presence of BAY, but p50TAD homodimers were also inhibited, particularly when the RelBCons RE reporter was used. At the 20μM dose, the molecule inhibited the NF-κB-independent basal transcription of the reporter, suggesting a general repressive effect on constitutive transcription possibly due to some toxicity to yeast cells. While the mechanism of the effect of BAY-11-7082 in yeast resulting in the apparent modulation of p65 and p50 function remains to be elucidated, the effect was independent from IκBα or the IκBα kinase IKK. Notably, BAY treatment did not lead to a reduction in p65 or p50 steady state protein levels\n",
      "We also tested EP, which may directly target p65 and inhibit in vitro DNA binding [8]. Although it reduced both p65- and p50TAD-dependent transactivation in a dose-dependent manner, western blot analysis indicated that this effect could be due to a reduction in protein levels. However, even at high dose EP did not impact basal expression of the reporter or the growth of yeast. EP did not affect p53 transactivation up to the 5mM dose nor it impacted on p53 protein levels at 2.5 or 5mM (Fig C in S1 File). Thus, there may be a specific impact of EP on NF-κB proteins stability, but the mechanism of action of EP in our assay system remains to be established. Although parthenolide had been shown to inhibit directly and indirectly IKK [46] [55], and possibly also to directly inhibit NF-κB subunits [56], we did not observe any effect of this molecule on NF-κB-dependent transactivation in yeast\n",
      "In conclusion, our studies highlight the significance of κB-RE sequence in the transactivation specificity of NF-κB transcription factors. In fact, the transactivation abilities of p65 and p50 NF-κB proteins acting as homodimers can be distinguished with respect to κB-RE sequence specificity, and co-expression of both transcription factors can be particularly effective on selected RE sequences. Importantly, these findings with the yeast system along with the use of the p50TAD provide new opportunities to dissect the transactivation specificity of individual NF-κB protein members and the role of κB-REs, including the interaction between closely spaced REs. In addition, our results suggest that small molecules targeting NF-κB proteins can have a differential impact depending on the κB-RE being tested. Ideally this could open up the possibility to identify modifiers that can target selected NF-κB functions, for example by including in the yeast assay cofactors such as Bcl-3, CREB, p300, Tip60 that play important roles in shaping the NF-κB-directed gene regulatory network [57]\n",

Tumor-suppressor protein p53 and nucleotide excision repair factor XPC each contain an acidic region, termed the acidic transactivation domain (TAD) and acidic fragment (AF), respectively, that binds to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the p62 subunit of the transcription factor TFIIH. Human p53-TAD contains seven serine and two threonine residues, all of which can be phosphorylated. Similarly, XPC-AF contains six serine and two threonine residues, of which Thr117, Ser122 and Ser129 have been reported as phosphorylation sites in vivo, although their phosphorylation roles are unknown. Phosphorylation of Ser46 and Thr55 of p53-TAD increases its binding ability; however, the role of XPC-AF phosphorylation remains elusive. Here we describe a system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and p62-PH affinity of p53-TAD and XPC-AF using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Unexpectedly, among seven reported kinases that presumably phosphorylate Ser46 and/or Thr55 of p53-TAD, only two specific and high-efficiency enzymes were identified: JNK2α2 for Ser46 and GRK5 for Thr55. During interaction with p62-PH, four different affinity complexes resulting from various phosphorylation states of p53-TAD by the kinases were identified. The kinetics of the site-specific phosphorylation reaction of p53-TAD and its affinity for p62-PH were monitored in real-time using the NMR system. Isothermic calorimetry showed that phosphorylation of Ser129 of XPC-AF increases binding to p62-PH. Although CK2 was predicted to phosphorylate Ser122, Ser129 and Ser140 from its sequence context, it specifically and efficiently phosphorylated only Ser129. Simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and augmentation in p62-PH binding identified a key residue of p62-PH for contacting phosphorylated Ser129. In summary, we have established an NMR system for real-time and simultaneous monitoring of site-specific phosphorylation and enhancement of affinity between phosphorylation domains and their target. The system is also applicable to other posttranslational modifications\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The tumor-suppressor p53 has critical roles in DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, metabolism and autophagy in response to cellular stress.1, 2, 3, 4 One of the reasons why p53 can be an exceptionally multifunctional protein is its ability to fulfill paradoxical interactions, in other words, it has specific and malleable interactions with various partners. The acidic transactivation domain (TAD; residues 1–61) at the N-terminus is important for p53 transcription activity through its interaction with transcriptional co-activators, co-repressors and general transcription factors. p53-TAD consists of two homologous subdomains, TAD1 (residues 1–42) and TAD2 (residues 43–61). Both domains function as hubs, contacting multiple partners in intricate networks\n",
      "p53 is subjected to diverse posttranslational modifications, which contribute significantly to its specific and malleable interactions. In particular, p53-TAD is subject to phosphorylation.5, 6 Human p53-TAD has nine phosphorylation sites: Ser6, Ser9, Ser15, Ser20, Ser33, Ser37, Ser46, Thr18, and Thr55, all of which have been implicated in activation of p53 upon stress.7 For example, phosphorylation of Ser46 activates p53 apoptotic activity,8, 9 whereas phosphorylation of Thr55 is involved both in G1 cell cycle progression via the degradation of p53,10 and in nuclear export of p53.11\n",
      "As demonstrated for p53 and many key hub proteins, phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications are essential for modulating intermolecular interactions. For instance, single-site and multiple-site phosphorylation of Ser15, Thr18, Ser20, Ser33, Ser37, Ser46, and Thr55 in human p53-TAD increase the affinity of p53 for the TAZ1/CH1, KIX, TAZ2/CH3 and NCBD/IBiD domains of its co-activators, CBP and p300.12, 13, 14, 15 In addition, phosphorylation of Thr18 decreases the interaction of p53 with its main negative regulator HDM2/MDM2,16 and phosphorylation of Ser46 and Thr55 increases its p53 affinity for the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the p62 subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH.17, 18 p62 is also a critical hub protein, functioning in both transcription and DNA repair\n",
      "Similar to p53-TAD, the acidic fragment (AF; residues 109–156) of the nucleotide excision repair factor XPC binds to p62-PH.19, 20, 21 XPC-AF contains six serine and two threonine residues, of which Thr117, Ser122 and Ser129 have been reported as phosphorylation sites in vivo,22, 23 although their phosphorylation roles are unknown\n",
      "A large number of studies have demonstrated that, in response to stress, p53 is stabilized and activated by altering its interactions with its binding partners via phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications. However, few methods for monitoring its changing interactions in real time upon modification at an atomic level have been described thus far. To address this issue, here we have used real-time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy24 to study the interaction of the p53-TAD, as well as XPC-AF, with p62-PH. First, we identified highly specific kinases for p53-TAD, namely c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 2α2 (JNK2α2) for Ser46 and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) for Thr55, and verified the high efficiency of these kinases by analyzing the kinetics of the phosphorylation reactions. After demonstrating the existence of four different affinity complexes of p53-TAD and p62-PH arising from the different phosphorylation states of p53-TAD, we simultaneously monitored the site-specific phosphorylation and augmenting interaction of p53-TAD with p62-PH in real time. For XPC-AF, we first showed that Ser129 was specifically and efficiently phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CK2), which strengthened binding of XPC-AF to p62-PH. We then monitored the enhancement in complex formation mediated by Ser129 phosphorylation in real time by NMR, identifying a key residue of p62-PH for interaction with phosphorylated Ser129 of XPC-AF\n",
      "Results\n",
      "JNK2α2 and GRK5 specifically phosphorylate Ser46 and Thr55 of p53-TAD, respectively\n",
      "Initially, we attempted to establish a system for the real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the dual phosphorylation of Ser46 and Thr55 located in the TAD2 region of p53 and the resulting increased interaction of p53 with p62-PH. We therefore sought to identify kinases specific for each residue of p53-TAD and tested well-known candidate kinases: cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)25 and protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ)26 for Ser46; extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2)27 and GRK528 for Thr55; and CK1, CK2 and JNK2α2, three kinases that are known to phosphorylate residues Ser20, Ser33, Ser37, Ser46, Thr18 and Thr55.14 We added each candidate kinase (2.5 μg) to 100 μl of 50 μM\n",
      "15N-labeled p53-TAD (residues 1–73) (Figure 1a) and monitored whether a phosphorylation reaction occurred at Ser46 or Thr55 using NMR (Figures 1b–i)\n",
      "CDK5 and PKCδ did not phosphorylate any residues under the conditions used (Figures 1c and d). We therefore independently verified the activity of both kinases for their substrate peptides by NMR: CDK5 specifically phosphorylated a histone H1 peptide (PKTPKKAKK) and PKCδ phosphorylated a PKC peptide (ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV) (Supplementary Figure S1). CK1 specifically phosphorylated Ser37 (Figure 1e). Although ERK2 has been reported to phosphorylate Thr55, we found that it efficiently phosphorylated Ser33 and also Ser46 (Figure 1f). CK2 phosphorylated both Ser46 and Thr55; however, the reaction seemed to be comparatively slow, especially for Ser46 (Figure 1g). Overall, highly specific phosphorylation of Ser46 was obtained with JNK2α2 (Figure 1h) and that of Thr55 with GRK5 (Figure 1i)\n",

      "To examine the kinetics of the enzymatic reactions of JNK2α2 and GRK5, phosphorylation of p53-TAD was monitored in real time by NMR (Figure 2). Using 150 μl of 25 μM\n",
      "15N-labeled p53-TAD as a substrate, 1.0 μg of JNK2α2 achieved ~100% of phosphorylation at Ser46 within 1 h (Figures 2a and b and Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). In contrast, 2.5 μg of GRK5 took ~5 h to achieve ~80% phosphorylation of Thr55 (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figures S2 and S3)\n",
      "Four different affinity complexes result from the phosphorylation states of p53-TAD\n",
      "In a previous study, we determined the structure of the complex between the p53-TAD2 peptide (residues 41–62), doubly phosphorylated on Ser46 and Thr55, and p62-PH of TFIIH using NMR and revealed that phosphorylated Ser46 and Thr55 make electrostatic contacts with K18/K19 and K54, respectively, of p62-PH (Figure 3a).18 (Note that, to avoid confusion, residues of p53 and XPC are represented by three-letter code and those of p62 are represented by one-letter code in this paper.) We also quantitatively examined the effects of phosphorylation of p53-TAD2 on binding to p62-PH by using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR. Single phosphorylation of Ser46 or Thr55 increased the binding ~4-fold (Kd=6 μM) or ~5-fold (Kd=5 μM), respectively, and dual phosphorylation further enhanced the binding ~25-fold (Kd=1 μM).18 Here we asked whether the four complexes with different affinities could be distinguished on a 1H,15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum during the phosphorylation reaction. To investigate this, we compared the spectra of 15N-labeled p62-PH complexed with unphosphorylated, Ser46-phosphorylated, Thr55-phosphorylated and Ser46, Thr55 double-phosphorylated p53-TAD2 peptides. Notably, many signals from interacting residues and nearby residues of p62-PH, such as E58 and T74, could be distinguished from each other in the four different affinity complexes (Figures 3b and c and Supplementary Figure S4). We therefore considered that, by using real-time NMR to monitor these distinctive signals from p62-PH in the transition from the p53-TAD2-unphosphorylated, low-affinity complex, through the singly phosphorylated, high-affinity complex, to the dual phosphorylated, highest-affinity complex during the phosphorylation reaction, we would be able to follow the increasing interaction between p53-TAD phosphorylated at Ser46/Thr55 and p62-PH. Furthermore, if 15N-labeled p53-TAD were used, then the site-specific phosphorylation reaction could be monitored at the same time, as mentioned above (Figure 2)\n",
      "Real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the dual phosphorylation of p53-TAD and its increasing interaction with p62-PH\n",
      "In order to monitor the interplay between the p53 TAD2 kinases JNK2α2 and GRK5, p53-TAD2 and p62-PH in real time, we designed the experimental procedure shown in Figure 4a. The experiment was started by addition of 2.5 μg of GRK5 into 150 μl of 25 μM solution of a complex of 15N-labeled p53-TAD and 15N-labeled p62-PH in an NMR tube. Unfortunately, the signal from Thr55 disappeared when p53-TAD bound to p62-PH. However, because phosphorylation of a residue changes the local environment, as reflected in the chemical shift of residues around the phosphorylation site, we were able to follow the phosphorylation reaction of Thr55 by monitoring signals from the neighboring Glu51, Gln52 and Trp53 residues of p53-TAD (Supplementary Figure S5)\n",
      "Phosphorylation of Thr55 of p53-TAD exponentially increased and reached ~100% at ~390 min (Figure 4b). Alongside the progression of the phosphorylation reaction at Thr55, signals from E58 and T74 of p62-PH started moving from their positions in the low-affinity complex toward their positions in the high-affinity complex immediately after the addition of GRK5 and stopped moving when the phosphorylation of Thr55 of p53-TAD was complete (Figures 4c and d)\n",
      "The sample was then removed from the NMR magnet, 1.0 μg of JNK2α2 was added at 391 min and NMR monitoring was immediately resumed. Phosphorylation of Ser46 of p53-TAD by JNK2α2 increased exponentially and reached saturation at ~80 min (Figure 4e). The phosphorylation reaction at Ser46 in the Thr55-phosphorylated p53-TAD in complex with p62-PH was relatively slow as compared with p53-TAD alone or when unphosphorylated p53-TAD in complex was used as a substrate (Figure 2b vs Figure 4e and Supplementary Figure S6). Upon addition of JNK2α2, signals from E58 and T74 in p62-PH started shifting from their positions in the high-affinity complex to their positions in the highest-affinity complex (Figures 4f and g). At the same time that the phosphorylation reaction of Ser46 reached saturation, these signals stopped shifting\n",
      "A phosphorylation site in XPC that affects its interaction with p62-PH\n",
      "Next, we applied the NMR method to a complex of XPC with p62-PH in order to identify a residue in XPC that would affect the intermolecular interaction by its phosphorylation. To this end, we initially identified the p62-PH-binding site in XPC by NMR. No tertiary structures of the complex between human XPC-AF and p62-PH have been determined; however, a complex structure of the AF of Rad4, the budding yeast homologue of human XPC, bound to the PH domain of Tfb1, the yeast homologue of the human TFIIH p62 subunit is available.21 Keeping this in mind, we first examined the complex structure of human XPC-AF bound to human p62-PH, while noting that the complex structure of p53-TAD bound to human p62-PH differs considerably from that of p53-TAD bound to yeast Tfb1-PH owing to different surface characteristics of the PH domains of p62 and Tfb1.18\n",
      "We prepared 13C/15N-labeled XPC-AF (residues 109–156) (Figure 5a). Similar to p53-TAD, which contains seven serine and two threonine residues, XPC-AF contains six serine and two threonine residues (Figure 1a) and is likely to be largely unstructured in the unbound state. The addition of p62-PH to XPC-AF drastically dispersed several specific signals of XPC-AF on the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum, indicating the formation of a stable structure of the complex (Figure 5b). Signal assignment for XPC-AF identified residues 125–139 as the binding site for p62-PH (Figure 5c)\n",
      "Phosphorylation of Ser129 in XPC-AF increases its affinity for p62-PH\n",
      "The binding site in XPC-AF contained one serine residue, Ser129, but it was unknown whether phosphorylation of this residue would have any effect on its interaction with p62-PH. We therefore compared the binding activities of an XPC peptide (residues 124–142) that was unphosphorylated and phosphorylated at Ser129 by using ITC. The unphosphorylated XPC peptide bound to p62-PH with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 132 nM (Figure 6a), whereas the Ser129-phosphorylated XPC peptide showed ~3.2-fold stronger binding to p62-PH with a Kd of 41 nM (Figure 6b)\n",
      "CK2 specifically phosphorylates Ser129 of XPC-AF\n",
      "Considering the sequence context of Ser129 in XPC-AF, we reasoned that CK2 would be likely to phosphorylate Ser129, together with Ser122 and Ser140. To examine the activity and specificity of CK2 for XPC-AF, we added 2.5 μg of CK2 to 150 μl of 50 μM\n",
      "15N-labeled XPC-AF and monitored the phosphorylation reaction using NMR. CK2 specifically phosphorylated only Ser129 (Figure 7a). Next, we used real-time NMR to investigate the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction of CK2 and XPC-AF. Using a substrate of 150 μl of 50 μM\n",
      "15N-labeled XPC-AF, 2.5 μg of CK2 achieved ~100% phosphorylation of Ser129 within ~3 h (Figures 7b and c and Supplementary Figure S7)\n",
      "Real-time and simultaneous monitoring of the phosphorylation and enhanced interaction of XPC-AF with p62-PH\n",
      "To monitor the process whereby the binding between XPC-AF and p62-PH becomes a high-affinity interaction by the phosphorylation of XPC-AF at Ser129 in real time, we designed the experiment shown in Figure 8a. NMR spectra were collected starting from the addition of 2.5 μg of CK2 to 150 μl of a 50 μM solution of a complex of 15N-labeled XPC-AF and 15N-labeled p62-PH in an NMR tube. In monitoring the phosphorylation of XPC-AF at Ser129 in the unbound state, we utilized signals from the neighboring residues, Glu128 and Asn131, in addition to Ser129 (Supplementary Figure S7). In the complex, several signals from XPC-AF, including Ser129 and Asn131, overlapped with those from p62-PH; however, we could monitor the phosphorylation of Ser129 by using isolated signals from Glu128 (Figure 8b). Phosphorylation of Ser129 increased exponentially and reached ~80% at ~2 h (Figure 8c). During this time, several limited signals from p62-PH changed. K62 was the residue that was most affected with respect to chemical shift (Supplementary Figure S8). The signal from K62 of p62-PH observed at 0 min gradually disappeared as the phosphorylation of Ser129 of XPC-AF increased (Figure 8d). As the same time, a new signal, corresponding to K62 of p62-PH in complex with Ser129-phosphorylated XPC-AF, gradually appeared. Whereas the intensity of the former signal exponentially decreased (Figure 8e), that of the latter exponentially increased (Figure 8e), similar to the build-up curve of the increasing signal from Glu128 of XPC-AF (Figure 8c)\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "For studies on multifunctional proteins such as p53, in which each of many phosphorylation sites is intimately associated with a particular function by regulating intermolecular interactions, real-time NMR spectroscopy can be a very useful method for observing not only changing phosphorylation states but also the resulting changes in interactions with the partners. To demonstrate this, here we focused on phosphorylated p53-TAD2 and its interaction with one of its targets, p62-PH of the general transcription factor TFIIH, because of the availability of the structure of this complex.18 Knowledge of tertiary structure can help us to correctly interpret experimental results. Although eight tertiary structures of unphosphorylated p53-TAD (TAD1 and/or TAD2) bound to its targets have been determined,17, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 a structure containing phosphorylated p53-TAD has only been solved for p53-TAD2 phosphorylated at Ser46 and Thr55 bound to p62-PH.18 Interestingly, in contrast to the amphipathic helix structures of unphosphorylated p53-TAD1 and p53-TAD2 observed in the other complexes, phosphorylated p53-TAD2 in this structure forms an extended string-like structure enabling it to make extensive and optimal contacts (Figure 3a)\n",
      "Unexpected results were obtained by NMR regarding the specificities of seven enzymes known as p53-TAD2 kinases (Figure 1). Only JNK2α2 for Ser46 and GRK5 for Thr55 were found to be site-specific kinases for p53-TAD. The kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction analyzed by NMR in real time indicated that these kinases are efficient enzymes (Figure 2). It was previously reported that transient overexpression of GRK5 in osteosarcoma cells significantly increased phosphorylation of p53 at Thr55, whereas knockdown of GRK5 decreased it; in addition, Thr55 phosphorylation promoted degradation of p53, leading to inhibition of p53-dependent DNA damage-induced apoptosis.28 Phosphorylation of Thr55 of p53 by GRK5 was also observed to occur during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle in a normal retinal pigment epithelial cell line, contributing to the regulation of p53 expression.35 By contrast, phosphorylation at Ser46 by JNK2α2 in vivo has not been reported; as a result, experiments on the transient overexpression of JNK2α2 and knockdown of JNK2α2 in cells remain to be conducted in future studies. However, we do not rule out the possibility that these unexpected results are due to the conditions used in the experiments. Another possibility is interplay among phosphorylation sites; for example, phosphorylation of some residues might require prior phosphorylation at another specific site. It will be interesting to test these possibilities by NMR\n",
      "The four different affinity complexes between p53-TAD and p62-PH arising from different phosphorylation states of p53-TAD—namely, the low-affinity complex (unphosphorylated p53-TAD), two moderate-affinity complexes (p53-TAD singly phosphorylated at Ser46 or Thr55) and the high-affinity complex (p53-TAD doubly phosphorylated at Ser46 and Thr55)—could be distinguished from each other via the signals from p62-PH on a 1H,15N HSQC spectrum (Figure 3). Thus the real-time NMR monitoring system enabled us to successfully observe the process of site-specific phosphorylation of p53-TAD via signals from p53-TAD simultaneously with the formation of complexes of increasing affinity via signals from p62-PH (Figure 4). Quantitative analysis of the 1H,15N HSQC spectrum for a complex in which both proteins are labeled with 15N can incur problems with overlapping signals because of the increasing numbers of residues. In the present method, however, such a problem was overcome by using isolated signals from residues that are influenced by the difference in affinity between complexes, even though they are not directly interacting residues and the difference is small. The contact surfaces on p62-PH are essentially identical in the four complexes.18 E58 and T74 of p62-PH, which were utilized to discriminate the complexes, do not directly interact with p53-TAD2 (Figure 3). E58 is located ~17 and ~12 Å away from phosphorylated Ser46 and Thr55, respectively, in p53-TAD2 (backbone N–N distance), while T74 is ~10 and ~14 Å away, respectively. The difference in affinity was found to be approximately fivefold in Kd between the unphosphorylated complex and the Thr55-phosphorylated complex and between the Thr55-phosphorylated complex and the Ser46, Thr55 double-phosphorylated complex. Considering these factors, the differences in the chemical shift values of E58 and T74 of p62-PH among the four affinity complexes would be rather small. Nevertheless, changes in E58 and T74 could account for the increases in complex affinity that occurred concomitantly with each phosphorylation of Thr55 and phosphorylation of Ser46 (Figures 4c, d, f and g)\n",
      "In this way, real-time NMR monitoring is extremely useful in evaluating the impact of phosphorylation on protein–protein interactions, as well as enzymatic activity, specificity and kinetics. In the present study, we used 1H and 15N atoms of the protein backbone to monitor the altering intermolecular interaction, but other atoms will offer different types of structural information. For example, monitoring 13C atoms in a protein backbone can enable the observation of changes in the secondary structure of a protein of interest\n",
      "Real-time NMR monitoring has also proved to be beneficial in identifying a key residue involved in modulating an interaction with a partner via phosphorylation. Similar to p53-TAD, XPC-AF has many potential phosphorylation sites (Figures 5a and 1a). According to the posttranslational modification database, PHOSIDA,22, 23 Thr117, Ser122 and Ser129 in XPC-AF are phosphorylated in vivo; to date, however, no studies on the role of these phosphorylated residues have been reported. Notably, the binding site for p62-PH identified in XPC-AF during the NMR chemical shift perturbation experiment contained a serine residue, Ser129 (Figure 5). The small change in the chemical shift of Ser129 in XPC-AF upon binding to p62-PH suggested that unphosphorylated Ser129 is unlikely to directly participate in the interaction (Figure 5). From this result, we speculated that phosphorylated Ser129 might alter the affinity of XPC-AF for p62-PH. An ITC experiment demonstrated that phosphorylation at Ser129 increases the binding affinity ~3.2-fold (Figure 6)\n",
      "To observe the increasing affinity of XPC-AF for p62-PH due to phosphorylation of Ser129 in real time, we needed to identify a candidate kinase. Real-time NMR spectroscopy revealed that CK2, which was predicted to be a likely kinase from the sequence context, specifically and efficiently phosphorylated XPC-AF at Ser129, despite the presence of two other potential phosphorylation sites (Figure 7). Thus, by using real-time NMR monitoring, we could observe the transition from the high-affinity complex to the higher-affinity complex resulting from the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ser129 in XPC-AF (Figure 8). In the case of the p53-TAD and p62-PH complex, the signals from p62-PH in the lower-affinity complex gradually moved toward their positions in the higher-affinity complex during the phosphorylation (for example, see E58 and T74 of p62-PH; Figures 4c, d, f and g). In the XPC-AF and p62-PH complex, by contrast, the intensity of signals from p62-PH in the unphosphorylated, lower-affinity complex decreased, while new signals appeared at a different position in the phosphorylated, higher-affinity complex and gradually grew in intensity, consistent with the progression of phosphorylation (for example, see K62 of p62-PH; Figure 8e). This difference is attributed to variations in the exchange rates of the complexes on the NMR timescale: the p53-TAD and p62-PH complexes are in fast exchange (that is, soft complexes), whereas the XPC-AF and p62-PH complexes are in slow exchange (that is, hard complexes). Thus the hardness of a complex can be seen in the changing patterns of the NMR signals of that complex\n",
      "To interpret the results of the increased affinity of the XPC-AF and p62-PH complex arising from phosphorylation of Ser129 in XPC-AF from the point of view of tertiary structure, we built a structural model of the complex based on the structure of p53-TAD2 and p62-PH using the Modeller program36 (Supplementary Figure S9). In the model, Ser129 of XPC-AF is in close proximity to K62 of p62-PH. Although the correct answer awaits experimental determination of the complex structure, we speculate that the observed increase in binding affinity is due to the generation of an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged phosphorylated Ser129 of XPC-AF and K62 of p62-PH\n",
      "In summary, we have established a real-time NMR system for monitoring the site-specific phosphorylation of p53 and XPC simultaneously with the enhancement in affinity for their target, p62-PH. We have also demonstrated that real-time NMR monitoring can be a valuable tool for exploring phosphorylation-mediated regulatory mechanisms of intermolecular interactions. The present method is not limited to phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation). Other posttranslational modifications such as acetylation and methylation perturb the local environment around the modified site,37, 38, 39 thereby altering the chemical shift values of the modified residue and its neighboring residues. It will therefore be possible to investigate the effects of these modifications on protein–target biomolecule interactions, as well as being able to study protein–drug interactions. In addition, in-cell NMR spectroscopy has been extensively developed to characterize the dynamic behavior of proteins in cells.40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46 We expect that the present method will be valuable for in vivo studies\n",

      "Motivation: Nowadays, knowledge extraction methods from Next Generation Sequencing data are highly requested. In this work, we focus on RNA-seq gene expression analysis and specifically on case–control studies with rule-based supervised classification algorithms that build a model able to discriminate cases from controls. State of the art algorithms compute a single classification model that contains few features (genes). On the contrary, our goal is to elicit a higher amount of knowledge by computing many classification models, and therefore to identify most of the genes related to the predicted class\n",
      "Results: We propose CAMUR, a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent classification models. CAMUR iteratively computes a rule-based classification model, calculates the power set of the genes present in the rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set, and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified. CAMUR includes an ad-hoc knowledge repository (database) and a querying tool\n",
      "We analyze three different types of RNA-seq data sets (Breast, Head and Neck, and Stomach Cancer) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and we validate CAMUR and its models also on non-TCGA data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of CAMUR: we obtain several reliable equivalent classification models, from which the most frequent genes, their relationships, and the relation with a particular cancer are deduced\n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "Among next generation sequencing experiments, RNA-seq gene expression profiling stands out as the process of quantifying the transcriptome abundance by counting the RNA fragments (reads) that are aligned on a reference genome (Wang etal., 2009)\n",
      "In this work, we propose a new method for classifying RNA-seq case–control samples, which is able to compute multiple human readable classification models. We call this method and its software implementation CAMUR – Classifier with Alternative and MUltiple Rule-based models. Although RNA-seq data analysis tools (Howe etal., 2011; Kuehn etal., 2008) are widely used in case–control studies, the novelty of CAMUR consists in the extraction of several alternative and equivalent rule-based models, which represent relevant sets of genes related to the case and control samples. CAMUR extracts multiple classification models by adopting a feature elimination technique and by iterating the classification procedure\n",
      "CAMUR is based on the supervised learning approach (also called classification (Mehta etal., 1996)), the task of inferring a function from labeled training data (Tan etal., 2005b). Two data sets are required: (i) the training set, which consists of a group of training labeled samples, and hence each sample is a pair consisting of an input object – that can be a vector of features (attributes) – and its associated class label; (ii) the test set, which is used to classify new samples, after the inferred function is built; the test data may consists of a set of samples, whose class is known, but hidden and used only for verification purpose. Starting from the training set, a supervised machine learning algorithm builds the classification model based on the general hypotheses inferred from the features. Then, through this model, the classifier is able either to evaluate the model reliability on the test set, or to make predictions on new data. In other words, we can describe the classification problem as the process through which a system learns a mapping function (also called model) that assigns a sample to a class (Tan etal., 2005b). A classifier is the output of a supervised machine learning algorithm. There are many different state of the art classification algorithms: decision trees (Quinlan, 1993), rule-based (Boros etal., 2005; Cohen, 1995; Felici and Truemper, 2002; Frank and Witten, 1998; Gaines and Compton, 1995), ensembles (Bagging, Boosting, Random forest) (Dietterich, 2000), k-Nearest Neighbour (Dasarathy, 1990), linear regression (Seber and Lee, 2012), Naive Bayes (McCallum etal., 1998), neural networks (Haykin etal., 2009), Perceptrons (Riedmiller, 1994), Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) (Tipping, 2001). For further details about the supervised learning paradigm and the algorithms the reader may refer to (Weitschek etal., 2014). Classification algorithms are frequently used in gene expression profiles analysis (Golub etal., 1999; Li etal., 2004; Nogueira etal., 2003; Park etal., 2014; Pirooznia etal., 2008; Shaik and Ramakrishna, 2014; Shipp et al., 2002; Tan and Gilbert, 2003; Tothill etal., 2015), in particular for experimental samples classification, i.e. the automatic assignment of each sample to its belonging class (e.g. case–control) after examining its profile. Rule-based classification algorithms are widespread for analyzing gene expression profiles (Dennis and Muthukrishnan, 2014; Geman etal., 2004; Hvidsten etal., 2003; Tan etal., 2005a; Weitschek etal., 2015; Zhou etal., 2003). These types of algorithms produce a classification model composed of logic formulas that provide an immediate relationship between the class and one or more features (genes). The assignment of a given class to each sample is performed by taking into account the satisfiability of the rules. In particular, the classifier uses logic propositional formulas in disjunctive (or conjunctive) normal form (‘if then rules’) for classifying the given records. Each classification rule (r) can be represented as: ri: Antecedent → Consequent (e.g. feature1>0.7∧feature2<0.4∨feature3>0.9⇒control). The antecedent contains a conjunction of attribute tests, each one known as literal (e.g. feature1>0.7), the consequent represents the covered class (e.g. control). Examples of rule-based classifiers are RIPPER (Cohen, 1995), LSQUARE (Felici and Truemper, 2002), LAD (Boros etal., 2005), RIDOR (Gaines and Compton, 1995) and PART (Frank and Witten, 1998)\n",
      "We chose to analyze RNA-seq data with rule-based algorithms, because of their human readability, i.e. the investigator is provided with a list of meaningful features (genes) that appear in the rules. Specifically, among the state of the art classifiers we implement our method relying on the Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction – RIPPER algorithm, because it is a robust and effective rule-based approach that provides reliable case–control models in terms of classification rates and computational performances (Lehr etal., 2011). In RNA-seq, rule-based algorithms may provide a low number of features (genes) into the resulting rules. For example, in a binary classification problem the classifier can build a model made of only two rules, with two or three features (e.g. gene1>0.7∧gene2<0.4∨gene3>0.9⇒control). Although this fact does not affect the classification performances, many other features that have discriminant power may not be present in the classification model. Therefore, our aim is to extract a comprehensive amount of knowledge from the analyzed data composed of equivalent and alternative classification models (i.e. rules). For example, to maximize the knowledge extraction in RNA-seq samples classification, we aim to detect all the genes that are implied with the analyzed disease, i.e. the discriminant genes that appear in alternative classification models. For extracting multiple classification solutions, one approach is presented in (Deb and Reddy, 2003), where the authors found 352 different three-gene combinations providing a 100% correct classification to the Leukemia gene expression profile data available at (Golub etal., 1999), by extending a genetic algorithm (Deb etal., 2002) into a multi-objectives evolutionary one that finds multiple and multimodal solutions in one single run (Miettinen, 1999). Those are defined as solutions that have identical objective values, but they differ in their format. Furthermore, another classification approach is presented in (Gholami etal., 2012) and relies on a feature elimination method, which consists of choosing features and then, removing those that do not match an assumption criteria. The deletion is performed in order to obtain a smaller set of features that can perform as well as the larger one, and hence the computational overhead is reduced. However, the authors aim is not to extract alternative and equivalent classification models. Conversely, we aim to obtain more than one reliable classification model by performing an iterative feature elimination without implementing an optimization method\n",

      "First, the terminology adopted in the paper is introduced. We collect n samples, each one described by its m features (gene expression profiles) and labeled with a class (condition), e.g. normal – tumoral (We adopt The Cancer Genome Atlas terminology (i.e. normal – tumoral), where normal corresponds to a healthy sample (control) and tumoral to a diseased one (case).). The ith sample of the data set is represented by the vector gi=(gi1,gi2,…,gim,gic), where gij∈R, i=1,…,n, j=1,…,m and gic∈{normal,tumoral}. Therefore, the vectors g1,g2,⋯,gn compose the data matrix, whose rows correspond to the samples and whose columns to their features. The reader may refer to Table 1 for an example\n",

      "2.1 CAMUR: classifier with alternative and multiple rule-based models\n",
      "In this section, we describe CAMUR, a method and a software designed to find alternative and equivalent solutions for a classification problem. CAMUR is based on:\n",
      "In brief, the method iteratively computes a rule-based classification model through the supervised RIPPER algorithm, calculates the power set (or a partial combination) of the features present in the rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set, and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified\n",
      "a rule-based classifier (i.e. in this work RIPPER);\n",
      "an iterative feature elimination technique;\n",
      "a repeated classification procedure;\n",
      "an ad-hoc storage structure for the classification rules (CAMUR database)\n",
      "In greater details, CAMUR executes at first the RIPPER algorithm, which extracts from a training set the classification model that contains rules with a number of features (i.e. genes) and their values (i.e. quantification levels). Accuracy and F – measure (see Eq. 1) are used on a test set to evaluate the extracted classification model. Then, CAMUR stores the classification model and the results into a database and extracts the features from the generated model. We call this set of features St (where t is the current iteration) and we define the list where those features are memorized as FL. After that, CAMUR computes the power set of the features Pt by storing all the combinations into the main memory. In the following, we refer to the Original Data Set of features as ODS. Starting from Pt, the software performs a feature elimination by deleting from ODS one combination of features at time (i.e. an item of the power set) and executes the RIPPER classification algorithm on the new data set (ODS−ptj) with ptj∈Pt (ptj is the jth element of Pt and j=1,…,|Pt|). All the results of the elimination and classification steps are memorized in the CAMUR database. These operations are iterated on the new generated data sets (ODS−ptj) with ptj≠pkl where k < t and l=1,…,|Pk|, updating FL at each iteration. We highlight that the power set (Pt+1) generation on the new feature sets St+1 is performed by not taking into account duplicate combinations that occurred in previous power sets Pk with k∈[1,t+1). CAMUR terminates the execution when one of the following conditions is satisfied:\n",
      "At the end of this procedure, we have a collection of alternative classification models composed of several features that are able to distinguish the samples with high reliability. For evaluating the classification models and consequently to terminate the procedure, we adopt the accuracy and the F – measure (refer to Eq. 1). Given True Positives (TP), objects of that class recognized in the same class; False Positives (FP), objects not belonging to that class recognized in that class; True Negatives (TN), objects not belonging to that class and not recognized in that class; False Negatives (FN), objects belonging to that class and not recognized in that class, the measures are defined as follows:\n",
      " (1) F−measure=2P·RP+R;Accuracy=TP+TNTP+TN+FP+FN \n",
      "where P=TPTP+FP is the Precision and R=TPTP+FN is the Recall\n",
      "the reliability of the classification models is below a given threshold, e.g. F – measure (see Eq. 1) lower than 0.85;\n",
      "the list of features FL has been completely processed;\n",
      "the maximum number of iterations has been reached\n",
      "In the following, we provide an execution example of the algorithm. Given a data set composed of 10 features (genes) and 10 samples – 5 tumoral and 5 normal –, CAMUR extracts through the first execution of RIPPER a classification model composed of a set of rules (e.g. gene1>0.7∧gene2<0.4∨gene3>0.9⇒normal). The rules contain a set of three features S1={gene1, gene2, gene3} which is stored in the features list FL. Starting from S1 the power set (except the empty set) P1 is computed: P1={{gene1}, {gene2},{gene3}, {gene1,gene2}, {gene1,gene3}, {gene2,gene3}, {gene1,gene2,gene3}}. The first item of the power set is eliminated from the data set and the classification procedure is performed, which provides a new set of features, e.g. S2={gene3, gene4}. The first power set P1 is completely processed, generating a number of feature sets S, which are stored in FL. After the processing of P1, the power set P2 from S2 is computed and the classification is performed. The algorithm continues until one of the stopping criteria is verified. To speed up the procedure, it is worth noting that the next power set is computed and processed only when the current power set has been completely examined\n",
      "The computational time depends on: (i) the size of the power sets, which are related to the size of the feature sets Si – if the cardinality of the feature set is equal to m (m=|Si|), then the power set generation requires in the worst-case O(2m); (ii) the worst-case complexity of RIPPER, i.e. O(nlog2n) with n number of samples in the training set. Therefore, the total complexity of CAMUR is O(2mnlog2n). We highlight that usually the number of features present in rule-based classification models is limited, especially when dealing with two-class classification problems, as case–control studies\n",
      "Additionally, we investigate the possibility to iterate the feature elimination in different ways, and hence our algorithm can be executed as follows: loose mode, strict mode, double mode\n",
      "In the loose feature elimination mode, the algorithm performs a combined iterative feature elimination. As above-mentioned, this execution mode takes the model and the results from the first classification and builds the power set of the found features, whose combinations are iteratively eliminated from the data set. A classification step follows each elimination of the feature combinations. The new extracted features that are present in the current model are added to the features list FL and are going to be processed in the next iterations\n",
      "In the strict feature elimination mode, the algorithm performs a single iterative feature elimination. First, a classification with the RIPPER algorithm is performed, the features that appear into the rules are extracted, and then eliminated one by one. The classification is iterated after each elimination on the resulting data set. In contrast to the loose mode, once a feature is eliminated, it is never inserted again into the data set. Referring to the example given above, in the strict mode the execution is straightforward. Starting from the above-mentioned feature set S1, CAMUR proceeds with the elimination of gene1 from the original data set ODS and performs the classification on the new data set, obtaining S2={gene3, gene4}. Then, it eliminates gene2 from ODS−{gene1} and performs the classification again, obtaining S3. It finishes to process S1, and then all the other ones contained in FL if a proper stopping criteria is satisfied\n",
      "The strict mode is faster than the loose mode, this can be explained by the two main differences: (i) the strict mode does not compute the power set, so there are less classification procedures to run; (ii) on each classification run one discriminating feature is eliminated from the original data matrix. Therefore, the accuracy of the models may decrease faster. Conversely, the loose mode extracts more knowledge but is slower, because the computed power set has a 2m sets and for each one CAMUR runs the classification algorithm again\n",
      "Finally, it is possible to execute both the strict and the loose mode through the double mode. This execution mode performs first the strict and then the loose mode, storing all the models and results into the CAMUR database\n",

CAMUR ran a total of 1486 classification procedures with a percentage split sampling schema (80% training, 20% test) (Tan etal., 2005b). The classification procedures stopped either for the decreasing of the classification performances, or because the maximum number of iterations was reached. On average, the obtained precision, recall and F – measure values are greater than 99%. Within the generated rules CAMUR found 904 different genes, each gene is found on average 23.34 times (the occurrences of each gene range from 1 to 900). CAMUR computed 8182 sets of combinations (736 in strict mode and 7446 in loose mode), each one composed of 1–7 genes (average 2.57). The amount of removed sets is 1480 (364 in strict mode, 1116 in loose mode), which represent the removed genes from a data set.

An interesting example for the output interpretation of query 3 in Breast Cancer is: gene TMEM220|388335 occurs 33 times, and its attribute value is ≥2.6±0.007, and hence provides a strong and stable signal. Query 5 (pairs of features) displays 2212 pairs of genes and a counter of how many times they appear together. The pairs that appear mostly are depicted in Table 6. Additionally, it is worth noting that the user can define personalized queries and run them directly on the database\n",

      "Furthermore, among the gene lists extracted by CAMUR, we found 3 genes (i.e. ACOT7|11332, ADAR|103 and GLT25D1|79709) shared by Breast, Head and Neck and Stomach Cancer set: in panel a of Figure 3 we show all the overlaps among the three sets of genes through an Eulero-Venn diagram. A preliminary functional analysis on the human protein atlas (Uhlén etal., 2015) confirms the relation of those genes with the three above-mentioned cancer types\n",
      "Fig. 3. Eulero-Venn diagram of the CAMUR gene lists for BRCA, HNSC and STAD: (a) diagram of overlapped genes extracted by CAMUR; (b) diagram of the overlapped genes between the CAMUR gene lists and the differential expressed ones\n",
      "In order to strengthen CAMUR, we performed the following tests. Since we have not found other state of the art classification algorithms that implement multiple models extraction, a direct comparison of our method is not feasible. Therefore, we compared CAMUR with respect to a standard wide-spread technique that relies on the differential expression analysis (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) and that provides a list of statistically significant genes related to case–control samples, by applying Benjamini-Hochberg correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) to estimate a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value. We extracted a list of 1851, 787, 1296 genes with a P-value ≤0.001 for BRCA, HNSC and STAD, respectively. The above-mentioned lists were compared with those extracted by CAMUR. We found 36 for BRCA, 11 for HNSC, 99 for STAD genes that are shared in both lists (panel b of Fig. 3). The lists of shared genes are available as supplementary data S3. It is worth noting that the size of the lists extracted by CAMUR is smaller, and hence our approach allows to focus on few core genes related to the investigated disease. Additionally, most of those genes are not selected by the differential expression analysis enhancing the novelty of our approach\n",
      "Additionally, we ran several tests to validate CAMUR, its classification models, and its performances. The detailed results are available as supplementary data S4. First, we randomly selected ten BRCA rules extracted by CAMUR and verified them on two external breast cancer RNA-seq data sets of GEO (GSE56022 and GSM1308330). Most of the rules succeed in the identification of the diseased samples confirming the validity of our method: 9 out of 10 correctly cover the GSM1308330 samples, 7 out of 10 the GSE56022 ones (but we remark that 2 of the not successful rules cannot be applied because a gene is not present in the data set). Second, we tested CAMUR on a non-TCGA data set: the Wilms Tumor (WT) (Walz etal., 2015) of the (TARGET) project. It consists of 94 tissues (82 tumoral, 12 normal) and 58450 mRNA gene expression values normalized with the RPKM method. CAMUR performed 320 runs (212 loose and 108 in strict mode) finding 231 different genes with an average F-measure of 0.98. Third, we validated CAMUR on RNA-seq data of BRCA normalized with the RSEM method. CAMUR executed 2048 classification experiments (1895 loose and 153 in strict mode) and extracted 986 different genes with an average F-measure of 0.99. Finally, we performed a comparative analysis of CAMUR with respect to the SVM classifier by computing the same number of classification runs: both methods reached high reliable results (average F-measure of 0.97 for SVM, 0.99 for CAMUR) on all data sets. We remark that SVM outputs just a single classification model that cannot be easily interpreted by human experts\n",
      "4 Conclusion\n",
      "In this work, we presented CAMUR, a new method for multiple solutions extraction in rule-based classification problems. We showed that the amount of knowledge extracted by our algorithm is higher than a standard supervised classification. We described the two parts of CAMUR software package: MSE that performs the classification procedure and MSA that analyzes the obtained results. Additionally, we designed and developed a database for an effective and comprehensive knowledge extraction. We proved the efficacy of our algorithm on large sets of RNA-seq data, focusing on Breast, Head and Neck and Stomach Cancer from TCGA, and validating it on external data sets from TARGET and GEO. To conclude, CAMUR results as a reliable technique for solving classification problems by extracting many alternative and equally accurate solutions\n",
      "In future, we intend to test our method on other RNA-seq data sets in order to build a large knowledge repository of classification models related to a particular disease. The extracted genes may then be analyzed by domain experts with functional and enrichment analyses (D’Andrea etal., 2013). It would be also interesting to perform a simulation study for evaluating the performance of CAMUR under different scenarios in a quantitative manner. Additionally, we plan to integrate in our software other rule-based classifiers, as well as to enrich the software with new functions and higher performances. Finally, we plan to extend the analysis to other biological data sets as sequences classification, e.g. DNA-Barcoding\n",

It is composed of three domains: high-mobility group box (HMG box), dimerization (DIM) and transactivation (TAD). One of the main processes for regulation and variability of the pathways involving Sox9 is the self-gene expression regulation of Sox9. However, the subsequent roles of the Sox9 domains can also generate regulatory modulations. Studies have shown that TADs can bind to different types of proteins and its function seems to be influenced by DIM. Therefore, we hypothesized that both domains are directly associated and can be responsible for the functional variability of Sox9. We applied a method based on a broad phylogenetic context, using sequences of the HMG box domain, to ensure the homology of all the Sox9 copies used herein. The data obtained included 4,921 sequences relative to 657 metazoan species. Based on coevolutionary and selective pressure analyses of the Sox9 sequences, we observed coevolutions involving DIM and TADs. These data, along with the experimental data from literature, indicate a functional relationship between these domains. Moreover, DIM and TADs may be responsible for the functional plasticity of Sox9 because they are more tolerant for molecular changes (higher Ka/Ks ratio than the HMG box domain). This tolerance could allow a differential regulation of target genes or promote novel targets during transcriptional activation. In conclusion, we suggest that DIM and TADs functional association may regulate differentially the target genes or even promote novel targets during transcription activation mediated by Sox9 paralogs, contributing to the subfunctionalization of Sox9a and Sox9b in teleosts\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The Sox proteins are involved in many developmental processes [1] across different metazoan groups such as insects, nematodes, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals [2]. These proteins are members of a non-canonical family of DNA-binding domain known as the high-mobility group box (HMG box), consisting of approximately 80 residues in a twisted L-shape structure that binds to the minor groove of DNA [3]. The HMG proteins were discovered as acid-extractable chromatin components of high electrophoretic mobility [4], and its superfamily has been divided into three unrelated families, known as HMGA, HMGB and HMGN based on the systematic reference to their different DNA-binding domains [5, 6]. Canonical HMGs are architectural proteins and do not contain transactivation domains, in contrast to some transcription factors with non-canonical HMG-motifs that contain transactivation domains [7]. The Sox family proteins contain only one non-canonical HMG box domain with only about 20% sequence identity to the canonical DNA-binding domain of HMGB proteins [8]. The first Sox protein discovered was Sry (Sex determining region Y) [9] and since then around 20 Sox proteins have been identified in mice and humans. In general, the Sox proteins have been grouped based on the sequence and structural similarity of their HMG box domain [10]\n",
      "Sox9 (Sex Determining Region Y-Box 9), a member of the SoxE subgroup (comprised of Sox8, Sox9 and Sox10), plays an important role in a variety of developmental processes of mesoderm (cartilage [11, 12] and male gonad [13–15]), ectoderm (central nervous system [16, 17], neural crest [18, 19] and retina [20]) and endoderm (pancreas [21, 22], liver [22] and intestine [23]). Therefore, Sox9 is a broad regulator and it has been related to different developmental disorders. For instance, heterozygous Sox9 mutations cause campomelic dysplasia, a syndrome characterized by skeletal malformations and associated, in some cases, with XY sex reversal [13, 24]. In addition, it is related to some acquired diseases, such as fibrosis [25], sclerosis [26], tumorigenesis [27] and cancer [28]\n",
      "Although Sox9 is encoded by a single-copy gene in most vertebrates, studies have shown the existence of duplicate copies in teleosts [29] (hereafter named as Sox9a and Sox9b). According to recent data of gene expression in Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Oryzias latipes (medaka), the two copies seem to have undergone a lineage-specific subfunctionalization process [2, 30]\n",
      "In addition to the HMG box domain, Sox9 is composed of a self-dimerization domain (DIM) [31, 32], and two transactivation domains (TAD)–K2 and PQS [29, 33, 34]. In humans and mice, there is an additional TAD (known as PQA), which enhances the PQS transactivation activity but it is unable to activate transcription alone [34]. Additionally, since PQA is exclusive of mammals, it has been suggested that this domain is related to the SRY sex-determining mechanism of these organisms [35]. These domains from Sox9 have also been found in Sox8 and Sox10, and the annotations used for them are still nonconsensual in the literature. Therefore, we propose the aforementioned nomenclature compiled from different studies related to the SoxE proteins [31, 36–38]\n",
      "Studies have evaluated the effects of amino acids substitutions, deletions, frameshifts and truncations in Sox9 activity and have determined the functions of each domain [29, 31–34, 37]. Some questions arose based on these works: (i) Is there a functional and/or structural relationship between the domains?; (ii) Which domains can be responsible for the functional diversity observed in Sox9? Regarding the second question, we hypothesized that DIM and TADs are directly associated and responsible for the functional variability observed in Sox9. The premise for this hypothesis is that these domains may interfere and/or mediate the interactions with a distinct number of proteins. We believe that this binding plasticity could be a good regulatory strategy for transcriptional activation and repression\n",
      "A detailed analyses of coevolutions of Sox9 residues (including Sox9a and Sox9b) along with selective pressure calculations (Ka/Ks ratio) suggested that DIM and TADs are functionally or structurally associated and can be candidates to modulate the variability of Sox9 function\n",

      "The phylogenetic reconstruction of the HMG box sequences showed the SoxE subgroup with three well-supported branches comprising Sox8, Sox9 and Sox10 (S1 Fig)\n",
      "The sequences from the Sox9 branch were selected for a more detailed evolutionary analysis. An exclusive Sox9 phylogeny was generated and clearly showed three main clades, corresponding to Sox9, Sox9a and Sox9b, and only the teleost species exhibited the duplicate copies (Fig 1A)\n",

The aLRT (SH-like) values of branch support are shown. The corresponding clades for Sox9 (blue), Sox9a (green) and Sox9b (orange) are indicated. The database entries (accession numbers from GenBank or Ensembl) are shown with their corresponding annotations in the database in parenthesis.

The scale bar below the phylogenetic tree indicates the average number of nucleotides substitutions per site. (B) Dendogram of the synteny analysis, based on the closest genetic markers: the clades corresponding to Sox9 (blue), Sox9a (green) and Sox9b (orange) were obtained from the hierarchical manhattan clustering method, implemented in the R software\n",
      "Some inconsistencies were perceived comparing the gene annotations from the searched databases with our results. For instance, Sox9a and Sox9b were reversed annotated in Takifugu rubripes (fugu) and Clarias gariepinus (african sharptooth catfish); moreover, these genes were assigned as Sox9a2 and Sox9a1, respectively, in Monopterus albus (rice field eel). Other inconsistencies were observed and are shown in Fig 1A. The retrieved sequence from Cichla monoculus (peacock bass) was ortholog to Sox9b. The degenerate primers used may have annealed only to Sox9b, precluding the detection of Sox9a\n",
      "To overcome some undesired incongruences from phylogenetic analysis, possibly related to the high evolutionary rate of substitutions in sequences, an approach based on the combination of phylogenetic results with genomic array of genes can be helpful to corroborate evolutionary relationships. We already used this approach in a study of the Foxl2 gene [39]. Therefore, an additional support for the Sox9 evolutionary relationships was determined using the synteny information of specific genetic markers combined with a hierarchical clustering (Fig 1B) (S1 Table). We observed Sstr2 as the common genetic marker of the Sox9 single and duplicate copies in all the vertebrate groups analyzed, and Rasd1 and Adap1 as the specific markers of Sox9a and Sox9b in almost all the teleost groups analyzed. The specific markers of Sox9a were primarily Cops3 and Pemt but other makers were also observed, such as Lmf1, Vstm4b, Lrrc18b and Mapk8b. The main markers of Sox9b were Abca3, Tmc6a, Notum1a, Myadml2, Mafg, Pcyt2 and Cant1a. An exception was zebrafish Sox9b, in which none of those markers were found\n",
      "Intra-molecular coevolution within and among the Sox9 domains\n",
      "The inference of intra-molecular coevolutions indicated possible relations among the DIM, K2 and PQS domains in all the Sox9 homologs analyzed (Fig 2). Sox9a showed a large number of intra and inter-domain coevolutions, especially in K2 and PQS, with a large group of mutual correlations. Although less representative, Sox9b showed a similar profile. Even though Sox9 showed a divergent profile, it also evidenced relations among DIM, K2 and PQS but with a lower degree compared to Sox9a. Besides, Sox9 showed a higher number of coevolving residues that are located outside the annotated domains. Finally, the highly conserved HMG box domain exhibited the lowest number of coevolving amino acids\n",
      "10.1371/journal.pone.0156199.g002Fig 2 Network of coevolutions in the Sox9 proteins(A) The coevolutions are shown using D. rerio Sox9a, M. albus Sox9b and H. sapiens Sox9 as the reference sequences. The graph nodes indicate the amino acid with its corresponding position number in the reference sequence. The edges (lines) connect the pair of coevolving amino acids inferred from the CAPS program. Each amino acid is colored based on its localization in the corresponding Sox9 domain: DIM (purple), HMG box (light blue), K2 (orange), PQA (dark cyan) and PQS (red). The range (begin-end) of each domain is also depicted in the scheme. The sign for truncated regions (//) is used for fitting the figure dimensions. (B) The Sox9 multiple protein sequence alignment is indicated. The color of each domain follows the description aforementioned. Upper green bars evidence high conserved sites\n",
      "The results of Ka/Ks calculation showed that all domains are under purifying selection; K2 had the highest Ka/Ks ratio followed by PQS and DIM, whereas HMG box had the lowest value (S2 Table)\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "Paralogy of Sox9a and Sox9b: phylogenetic and syntenic approaches\n",
      "The divergence in gene annotation and the lack of protein tertiary structure of Sox9 difficult the determination of correlations between evolutionary events and their functional implications. Nakamura et al. [30] already settled, based on genomic synteny analyses, the nomenclature of Sox9 paralogs as Sox9a and Sox9b. However, these analyses were restricted to a small number of sequences and no phylogeny was inferred. In contrast, we gathered a representative data set of Sox9 sequences, based on a search over different vertebrate genomes. The imbalance in the number of sequences for Sox9a and Sox9b was due to the data availability at GenBank because only one of the paralog forms was found in the database for some species. Despite of this imbalance, it is evident, by the current data from the searched genomes, that the duplicate copies of Sox9 (referred to as Sox9a and Sox9b) are unique to the teleost lineage. Therefore, they were probably originated from the specific whole genome duplication occurred in this group [40, 41], in agreement with the suggestion of previous studies [2, 30, 42]. Moreover, we used the synteny information from Sox9 to generate a dendogram using a hierarchical-clustering algorithm, and the results also supported the paralogy of Sox9a and Sox9b, reinforcing the conclusions aforementioned\n",
      "DIM and TADs as important regions for functional plasticity\n",
      "Intra-coevolutionary inferences represent an important approach for understanding the evolution and function of proteins because structural and functional relationships or physical interactions between amino acids can be the main causes of their coevolution [43]. Mutations at functionally related sites can change the selective constraints, so coevolution inference is an important complement for molecular selection analysis [43]. Furthermore, it has been observed that physically distant coevolving sites can be essential to maintain the structural and functional stability of the protein [44]\n",
      "Our coevolution results show possible relationships among all the Sox9 domains from the single and duplicate copies but especially among DIM, K2 and PQS. Primarily, we observed a large group of coevolutions in Sox9a. Studies with single and frameshift mutations/deletions in TADs showed that, for maximum transactivation, K2 and PQS are critical for the proper transcriptional activation/repression of target genes [29, 34]. Therefore, this result is in agreement with our coevolution data that showed pairs of coevolving residues between K2 and PQS. Furthermore, we showed that K2 and PQS are under purifying selection and have the most relaxed selective pressure (primarily K2), reflecting a higher fixation of mutations. In general, most of the protein-protein interactions involved to orchestrate the assembly of the transcriptional machinery are mediated by TAD [45]; therefore, our results of coevolution and selective pressure suggest that this domain can be a good candidate for transcriptional regulation\n",
      "The transactivation process, however, depends on the oligomeric state of Sox9. It has been observed that Sox9 can bind to response elements of target genes as a homodimer or monomer, associating with different protein partners to activate or repress the transcriptional machinery [31, 32, 46, 47]. It has been observed that mutations within DIM abrogated the dimerization and ceased or reduced the transactivation activity played by Sox9 for target chondrogenic and sex-determining genes, whereas other functional features of the protein remained unaltered [32]. The most dramatic effect was observed in a 66–75 deletion within DIM, affecting the promoter activation of Amh, a sex-determing gene that only requires a Sox9 monomer for its activation, indicating that DIM is not limited to the dimerization function. We observed in the human Sox9 the residues 66 and 67 from DIM coevolving with the residues 281 and 409 from K2 and PQS, respectively. Altogether, these experimental data and our coevolutionary results indicate that DIM, apart from its dimerization function, may influence directly the transactivation activity\n",
      "Sock et al. [32] considered unlikely the direct interference between DIM and TAD (primarily PQS and PQA) because they are physically distant, considering the protein sequence. However, as we mentioned earlier, distant sites in a protein can be functionally or structurally associated; therefore, the transcriptional activation/repression of Sox9 target genes could be strictly related to the TAD affinity, influenced by DIM, to its binding partners. We suppose that these domains are physically close in the tertiary structure, or have some structural feature that a change in one domain may affect the other. This scenario agrees with our coevolutionary and selective pressure analyses, corroborating the relationship between DIM and TAD as a good strategy for the transcriptional regulation of pathways involving Sox9\n",
      "The HMG box domain, in contrast, had the lowest rate of mutational fixations and the lowest number of coevolving residues. The high conservation of the HMG box in the Sox9 sequences may be a result of its binding pattern [48], generating a significant constraint in the protein conformation. An exception was observed in Sox9a with a large group of amino acids from K2 and PQS coevolving with one amino acid from the HMG box. However, no experimental analysis indicates a direct functional or structural involvement between HMG box and TADs. Indeed, mutational analyses within the HMG box have shown that the transactivation activity is only abrogated as a consequence of a reduced affinity or inability of Sox9 to bind DNA [34, 49, 50]\n",
      "Finally, Sox9a and Sox9b, after the duplication event in teleosts, seem to have undergone a lineage-specific subfunctionalization, indicated by the similar tissue expression patterns in zebrafish Sox9a and medaka Sox9b [2, 30]. Although it requires additional data from other teleost species, we suggest that the functional association between DIM and TADs differentially regulate the target genes or even promote novel targets during the transcriptional activation mediated by the Sox9 paralogs. Therefore, this association makes DIM and TADs more flexible to promote a fine gene expression regulation along the subfunctionalization process\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "This study correlates evolutionary analyses with functional implications for the Sox9 proteins. First, we reinforce that the event of genome duplication specific of teleosts is the evolutionary process that triggered the evolution of Sox9a and Sox9b. We also suggest that DIM and TADs are candidates for functional modulation and variability of the Sox9 single and duplicate copies (Sox9a and Sox9b) in vertebrates, allowing the use of well-coordinated regulation strategies that can operate within and among these domains. Furthermore, our study correlates evolutionary analyses with functional implications of Sox9 and highlights that DIM and TAD can be additional players involved in the regulation and diversification of the Sox9 activity. Finally, this strategy could be also used by other transcription factors, such as SoxE proteins\n",
      "Materials and Methods\n",
      "Sequence acquisition and alignment procedures\n",
      "HMG box domain sequences\n",
      "To obtain a significant number of sequences and ensure the use of Sox9 homologs, a retrieval methodology based on the HMG box domain was used. This approach ensures a more accurate identification of homologous sequences to the gene of interest and facilitates the choice of outgroup\n",
      "Protein sequences of the HMG box family were collected from a large number of metazoans in the Pfam database [51] (accession: PF00505), totaling 4,921 sequences relative to 657 species (S3 Table). Each sequence, identified by an UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org) accession number, was converted to GenBank accession numbers utilizing the gbreader software (Razente HL, Braz ASK, Scott LPB (unpublished))\n",
      "To avoid redundancy and ensure the use of representative data, a clustering methodology was performed using the CD-HIT software [52]. The clustering cut-off applied was 99% identity to the HMG box domain (high cut-off because the HMG box domain is highly conserved in metazoan); afterwards, only one representative protein from each cluster was selected for the phylogenetic analysis. This previous procedure resulted in a data set of 779 sequences that were aligned based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile of the HMG box domain (final alignment length = 69 sites), using the HMMER v.3 software [53]\n",
      "Sox9 sequences\n",
      "In addition to the sequences obtained from the UniProt database, Sox9 sequences were obtained based on TBLASTN searches over the nucleotide collection from GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and the vertebrate genomes from the Ensembl database (http://www.ensembl.org/) [54]\n",
      "Additionally, an experimental procedure was employed to retrieve the Sox9 sequence from the neotropical cichlid peacock bass Cichla monoculus collected from Balbina hydroelectric station lake, Presidente Figueiredo-AM, Brazil (3°09’57”S, 59°54’44”W), according to the Brazilian laws for environmental protection (wild collection permit, ICMBio 22984–1 e 32556–2). Voucher specimens (10816-female; 10850-male) were included in the fish collection of INPA-National Institute for Amazonian Researchs, Manaus/AM. The experimental procedure on the teleost was conducted according to the international guidelines of Sao Paulo State University and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Protocol no. 34/08—CEEA/IBB/UNESP), and the tissue samples are available at Integrative Genomics Laboratory of Sao Paulo State University under the registration numbers 10816 and 10850. The animals were euthanized through immersion in a water bath with benzocaine 250 mg/liter during 10 minutes. The genomic DNA was extracted from muscle and liver tissues using the phenol-chloroform method [55]. Sox9 was amplified by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) using degenerate primers (F—5’ CARGTNYTNAARGGNTAYGA 3’ and R—5’ CCANARYTTNCCNARNGTYTT 3’) constructed with the Primer3Plus software [56]. For the construction of these primers, Sox9 protein sequences from different vertebrate species were retrieved based on a BLASTP search at the Expasy Proteomic Server (http://ca.expasy.org/), using the Sox9a sequence from Oreochromis aureus (EU373500) as query. These sequences were aligned using ClustalW [57], and the primers were constructed for the most conserved regions. The amplicons were 195 base pair (bp), and the full gene sequence (3,327 bp) was obtained by the genome walking technique, using the Genome Walker™ kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. All amplicons were cloned in p-GEM-T plasmid vectors (Promega), and the corresponding clones were sequenced with an ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer), using ABI Prism Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kits (Perkin-Elmer). Finally, a prediction of introns, exons and amino acid sequences were performed using the online program Softberry FGENESH (http://www.softberry.com/)\n",
      "Phylogenetic analyses: HMG box, SoxE and Sox9\n",
      "Three phylogenetic analyses were conducted separately: (i) HMG box, (ii) SoxE and (iii) Sox9. Based on the phylogeny of the HMG box domain, the corresponding branch for the subgroup E was determined (S1 Fig). Within this subgroup, the clustered amino acid sequences for Sox8, Sox9 and Sox10 were retrieved and aligned using the Mafft algorithm [58]. A maximum likelihood phylogeny was generated to allow the precise identification of the Sox9 homologs and guide the appropriate choice of outgroup. Afterwards, the Sox9 sequences were aligned based on their codons using the Mafft algorithm allocated on the GUIDANCE web server [59]. Finally, the reference data set for the Sox9 phylogeny was composed of 47 nucleotide sequences, and the alignment length included 2,049 sites (S1 Text). The phylogenetic analysis was performed using only complete and putative Sox9 sequences\n",
      "The choice of the best-fit model of evolution was performed with ProtTest3 [60] and Jmodeltest [61] for the amino acid and nucleotide sequences, respectively\n",
      "The phylogenetic reconstruction of Sox9 was determined by the maximum likelihood method, implemented in the Phyml v3.0.1 [62] software, using the aLRT (SH-like) reliability test [63] (other parameter details, see S4 Table). The visualization and the final tree edition were performed using FigTree v1.3.1 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) and ETE2 [64]\n",
      "Sox9 synteny analysis\n",
      "To provide an additional support to the homology of the Sox9 sequences and understand the composition/organization of the genes in the proximity of Sox9, the syntenic regions were analyzed in species which genomic information is available at the Genomicus browser [65]. A matrix was built based on the presence and absence of each genetic marker considered in the proximity of the Sox9 single and duplicate copies. Latter, a hierarchical clustering was performed based on the this matrix information (S1 Table), using the manhattan method available in the R program [66]\n",
      "Intra-coevolution inference and Ka/Ks ratio calculation\n",
      "The inference of intra-molecular coevolutions was done using the CAPS software [67]. CAPS measures the correlated evolutionary variation of amino acids to identify the coevolving site pairs. The performance and sensitivity of the method has been examined in different proteins [43] and, according to the authors, more accurate results can be achieved with long (≥ 20 sequences) and populated sequence alignments. The major advantage of CAPS over other methods of coevolutionary inference is the separation of phylogenetic linkage from structural and functional coevolution [43]\n",
      "Each branch corresponding to Sox9, Sox9a and Sox9b was extracted and submitted, along with its aligned protein sequences, to the CAPS analysis. The complete alignment and subalignments, combined with the removal of specific phylogenetic clades, were generated following the CAPS automated protocol to exclude phylogenetic coevolutions [43]. Finally, a total of 1,000 alignment simulations were generated to remove the stochastic effects of the coevolutions inferred for the Sox9 single and duplicate copies\n",
      "The Ka/Ks ratio calculations were conducted using the sequences of human Sox9 [GenBank:BC007951], zebrafish Sox9a [GenBank:NM_131643] and rice field eel Sox9b [GenBank:AF378150]. The calculations were based on the pairwise alignment (performed with Muscle [68]) of the HMG box, DIM, K2 and PQS domains, using the command line KaKs-Calculator v1.2 [69] with model selection parameter (S2 Table)\n",

      "Background\n",
      "Carcinogenesis involves changes in gene expression that results in tumor specific gene and protein signatures. Such signatures have been used to classify different subtypes of cancers. Gene expression is partly regulated by the methylation state of CpG islands. Cancer tissue is characterized by an increased variability in DNA methylation patterns. DNA methylation profiling has been reported as a robust method to classify and subgroup tumors of different origin [1]. For most pediatric brain tumor diagnoses, methylation profiling can divide the tumors into clinically relevant subgroups reflecting the diverse biology of the different subtypes which further highlights the need for specific therapeutic strategies to target different subgroups. With the increased knowledge about specific brain tumor subgroups and the development of targeted therapy for different entities, it is essential to quickly and accurately determine the correct diagnosis for pediatric brain tumor patients. The most popular and commonly used platform for genome-wide methylation profiling is the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 BeadChip arrays. These arrays profile ~485,000 CpG sites and have been used by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and in numerous studies of pediatric brain tumors. A correct diagnosis is vital for determining the appropriate treatment protocol for a specific patient, to select the right patients for clinical trials investigating novel therapy for specific diagnoses and subgroups and for basic researchers to be able to draw correct conclusions from experiments. We therefore developed the MethPed classifier [2], which is a multiclass random forest algorithm [3], based on DNA methylation profiles from many subgroups of pediatric brain tumors. We have now developed an R package that uses this method, making it easily available and accessible\n",
      "Implementation\n",
      "The MethPed classifier was developed using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm [3] for robust classification of unknown brain tumor samples into subtypes as described in Danielsson et al. [2]. Briefly, the RF algorithm was applied on beta values which are the estimate of methylation levels (between 0 and 1 with 0 being unmethylated and 1 fully methylated) using the ratio of intensities between methylated and unmethylated alleles generated by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip array. A training probe pool of 900 methylation sites that showed the highest predictive power (AUC values) in a large number of regression analyses was selected from 472 clinically diagnosed brain tumor cases available on GEO after necessary data cleaning and KNN imputation of missing values. The RF algorithm was then applied to classify unknown samples based on the selected training probe pool. See Fig. 1 for a summary of the workflow for the MethPed classifier and R package.Fig. 1 Implementation and workflow of the MethPed classifier and package\n",
      "The MethPed classifier can be accessed through the ‘MethPed’ package that can be downloaded from Bioconductor, a repository for bioinformatics related applications. The ‘MethPed’ package includes the MethPed classifier and an example data set of two tumors. The example data can be read into the R computing environment with the help of the data function after installing the package\n",
      "Data for running MethPed is generated by the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip arrays. Beta values for two samples (Tumor A and Tumor B) are provided with the ‘MethPed’ package as an example [2]. This data has no missing values. If missing values exist in a data set, the impute package can be used for missing value imputation, according to the MethPed vignette in Bioconductor\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "The MethPed analysis starts with loading the data, checking for missing values in the data file and thereafter runs through the classification. Error rate of the prediction is estimated and the probability that a sample belongs to one of nine tumor diagnoses/subgroups is given. In the current version of MethPed the following groups are included; glioblastoma (GBM), pilocytic astrocytoma, medulloblastoma (Wnt, Shh, group 3 and group 4), diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), ependymoma and embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR). These include the most common diagnoses and subgroups but not all. The robustness of a classifier is highly dependent on the accuracy of the training data and therefore we choose not to build in groups with limited data avaliable. With the MethPed classifier, the probability that a tumor sample belongs to a specific tumor group is presented (Fig. 2a), or if preferred, the group with the maximum probability leaving zero to the other tumor groups by supplying an extra parameter ‘prob = FALSE’ in the classifier (Fig. 2b). It should be note that for tumors belonging to diagnoses that are not included in the MethPed classification, these will be classified as inconclusive (with low probabilities of belonging to any of the groups) or to the most similar tumor form that is present in the classifier. For more information, see Danielsson et al. [2].Fig. 2 Bar plots on the diagnosis prediction of the two test samples. a Classification probability of a sample belonging to each of the pediatric brain tumor diagnoses currently included in MethPed and (b) Maximum classification probability of a specific tumor group for each sample\n",
      "The conditional probability matrix of the classification from the MethPed output can be observed by the ‘summary’ command in R. For visualization of the prediction, bar plots can be generated by using the ‘plot’ command (Fig. 2). If missing probes from the sample compared with the training data included with the package exist, these can be observed by the ‘probeMis’ command\n",
      "MethPed is currently the only publically available tool for classification of pediatric brain tumors. The use of methylation profiling for classification of these tumors adds new and important knowledge in the clinical setting for choosing the optimal care and treatment of these patients and will therefore likely complement histopathological diagnoses in the near future [1, 2]\n",

After these endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane, exosomes are secreted into the extracellular space. The ability of exosomes to carry and selectively deliver bioactive molecules (e.g., lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) confers on them the capacity to modulate the activity of receptor cells, even if these cells are located in distant tissues or organs. Since exosomal cargo depends on cell type, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the biochemical composition of exosomes is fundamental to a comprehensive view of exosome function. Here, we review the latest advances concerning exosome function and biogenesis in T cells, with particular focus on the mechanism of protein sorting at multivesicular endosomes. Exosomes secreted by specific T-cell subsets can modulate the activity of immune cells, including other T-cell subsets. Ceramide, tetraspanins and MAL have been revealed to be important in exosome biogenesis by T cells. These molecules, therefore, constitute potential molecular targets for artificially modulating exosome production and, hence, the immune response for therapeutic purposes\n",

      "Exosomes are nano-sized membranous vesicles (40–100 nm in diameter) that are secreted into the extracellular space by many cell types. The distinctive characteristic of these vesicles is their endosomal origin as intraluminal vesicles (ILV) within multivesicular endosomes (MVE). This origin contrasts with that of other extracellular vesicles of similar size such as shedding vesicles or ectosomes, which are released from the plasma membrane (Kalra et al., 2012; Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013). The accumulation of “membrane-bound vesicles” in the lumen of MVE as result of the inward invagination of its limiting membrane, as well as the release of “vesicular inclusions” into the extracellular space after the fusion of MVE with the plasma membrane was firstly observed by Philip Stahl's group in 1983 during studies of the traffic of the transferrin receptor in rat reticulocytes (Harding et al., 1983). This finding was consistent with the selective externalization of this receptor in vesicles by maturating sheep reticulocytes observed simultaneously by Rose Johnstone's group (Pan and Johnstone, 1983). A few years later, the term exosomes was coined to refer to the population of vesicles that are released into the extracellular space upon fusion of MVE with the plasma membrane and that can be recovered from the 100,000 × g pellet of cell-free supernatants of cell culture medium or extracellular fluids (Johnstone et al., 1987). Exosomes have been isolated from a great variety of cultured cells and body fluids, including ascite fluid (Andre et al., 2002; Navabi et al., 2005), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (Admyre et al., 2003), urine (Pisitkun et al., 2004), blood plasma (Caby et al., 2005), synovial fluid (Skriner et al., 2006), breast milk (Admyre et al., 2007), amniotic fluid (Keller et al., 2007), cerebrospinal fluid (Vella et al., 2008), saliva (Ogawa et al., 2008), semen (Poliakov et al., 2009), bile (Masyuk et al., 2010) and nasal mucus (Wu et al., 2015). Within the immune system, exosome secretion has been described in both innate and adaptive immune cells, including B cells (Raposo et al., 1996), dendritic cells (Zitvogel et al., 1998), platelets (Heijnen et al., 1999), mast cells (Skokos et al., 2001), T cells (Blanchard et al., 2002), macrophages (Nguyen et al., 2003) and natural killer cells (Lugini et al., 2012). A major breakthrough in our current understanding of exosome function is the finding that in addition to lipids, proteins and mRNA, exosomes contain miRNA that can be transferred to recipient cells to modulate their activity (Valadi et al., 2007). Therefore, although they were originally described as being a by-product of red cells maturation, it has become evident after 30 years of exosome research that exosomes play an active role as vehicles for intercellular communication by transporting a wide range of bioactive molecules between different cells and tissues (Tkach and Théry, 2016). This role allows exosomes to regulate many physiological activities, including the immune response\n",
      "General mechanisms of exosome biogenesis\n",
      "Exosomes originate as ILV during the maturation of MVE (Huotari and Helenius, 2011; Hanson and Cashikar, 2012). Depending on the final destination of their ILV, two main kinds of MVE are defined: degradative MVE, which fuse with lysosomes to promote the breakdown of their intraluminal content, and secretory MVE, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release their cargo into the extracellular space. In addition, MVE are implicated in the formation of specialized endosome compartments such as melanosomes in pigment cells and Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells (Marks et al., 2013). Independently of their final destination, ILV formation relies on the recruitment of specific lipids and proteins on the limiting membrane of MVE, and then on their lateral segregation in order to promote the organization of specialized subdomains, from where ILV inward budding occurs\n",
      "The protein content of exosome fractions obtained from the 100,000 × g pellet have been characterized in many types of cell. Exosomes contain proteins normally associated with intracellular trafficking such as Rab-family GTPases, annexins, SNAREs, and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-associated proteins tsg101 and Alix. Since the first description of the tetraspanins CD37, CD63, CD81, and CD82 being enriched in exosomes secreted by B-cells (Escola et al., 1998), various members of this extended family of proteins have been found as being enriched in exosomes of different cell origin (Andreu and Yáñez-Mó, 2014). Exosomes have high contents of cholesterol, sphingomyelin, ceramide and ganglioside GM3 (Wubbolts et al., 2003; Subra et al., 2007; Trajkovic et al., 2008; Llorente et al., 2013; Bosque et al., 2016), which are all of them lipids that are concentrated in condensed membrane domains often referred to as membrane rafts (Lingwood and Simons, 2010). Consistent with this observation, exosomes are enriched in proteins associated with these specialized membranes (Wubbolts et al., 2003; Staubach et al., 2009; Dubois et al., 2015), including molecules whose protein moiety is linked to the external leaflet of the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, such as CD59 and the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (Johnstone et al., 1987; Rooney et al., 1993; Rabesandratana et al., 1998; De Gassart et al., 2003) or is linked to the internal leaflet by fatty acids, such as Src-family tyrosine kinases (De Gassart et al., 2003), or by proteins with membrane-associated domains, such as caveolin-1 and the membrane tetraspanning MAL protein (Llorente et al., 2004; Ventimiglia et al., 2015)\n",
      "The ESCRT machinery is involved in the formation of ILV in MVE and the recruitment of ubiquitinated proteins to target them for degradation in lysosomes (Babst et al., 2002a,b; Bache et al., 2003). Tetraspanins on one hand, and lipids and proteins associated with condensed membranes on the other, promote segregation of specific membrane subdomains through the organization of protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction networks, respectively. Consistent with the presence in exosomes of ESCRT-associated machinery, tetraspanins and condensed membranes, it has been proposed that distinct molecular mechanisms sort the exosome cargo and deform the membranes required for the inward invagination of ILV destined for secretion as exosomes (Figure 1). However, whether these mechanisms act separately in the same cell to give rise to distinct subpopulations of MVE with a single type of ILV each, converge to generate distinct subsets of ILV in a single type of MVE, or coordinate to generate a single type of ILV structured into discrete membrane domains remains to be clarified. In this regard, evidence exists supporting either possibility. For instance, depending on their activation state, dendritic cells sort MHC II molecules to degradative MVE in a ESCRT-dependent manner or, upon the incorporation of MHC II molecules in tetraspanin-containing condensed membranes, to secretory MVE (Buschow et al., 2009). In addition, it was demonstrated that inactivation of the syndecan-syntenin-Alix axis in breast epithelial MCF-7 cells reduces the release of CD63-positive exosomes, suggesting collaboration between ESCRT and tetraspanins in the biogenesis of secretory MVE (Baietti et al., 2012). It is not clear why different cell types use distinct mechanisms for exosome biogenesis. A possibility is that, whereas most cargos can use any of the mechanisms, certain cargoes require specific machinery to be sorted to ILV destined for exosomes\n",
      "Figure 1 General mechanisms of exosome biogenesis. (A) The intraluminal budding of specific membrane nanodomains from the limiting membrane of MVE gives rise to ILV. The sorting of cargo and the invagination of ILV could be mediated by the activity of the ESCRT machinery (red), TEM (blue) or specific lipids such as cholesterol or ceramide (green). (B,C) Secretory MVE are transported to the plasma membrane and release their ILV into the extracellular space after membrane fusion. (D) The ESCRT-mediated sorting of ubiquitinated proteins gives rise to degradative MVE that fused with lysosomes for degradation of their intraluminal cargo. It is not known whether distinct exosomes and ILV to be secreted as exosomes exist or there is only one class with discrete subdomains. For the sake of simplicity, the three mechanisms were represented in the same MVE, but it remains to be determined whether each mechanism originates a specific kind of MVE or if different populations of ILV coexist in a single MVE. In addition three types of ILV and exosomes are represented although is not clear whether exist different three types of structure or a single structure with discrete subdomains. The molecules involved in the different processes are indicated\n",
      "ESCRT-mediated sorting\n",
      "The ESCRT machinery consists of five protein complexes known as ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III, and Vps4, and several accessory proteins including Alix (Henne et al., 2011; Schuh and Audhya, 2014). ESCRT components work sequentially in order to sequestrate ubiquitinated proteins in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate-enriched domains of the MVE limiting membrane and then facilitate the inward invagination of these domains, promoting the budding and pinching off of ILV. However, the involvement of the ESCRT in the formation of ILV with a secretory destination is less general and seems to be dependent on the cell type and the physiological status of the cells. An shRNA-based screen of 23 ESCRT components in epithelial HeLa cells showed that not all the members of the complex have a role in exosome formation (Colombo et al., 2013). Thus, silencing of the ESCRT-0 members Hrs and Stam1 or the ESCRT-I component tsg101 reduced the release of exosomes, whereas silencing of Vps4 increased it. A role for the accessory protein Alix in sorting the transferrin receptor into exosomes was also observed in erythrocytes (Géminard et al., 2004). In a different study Alix, tsg101, and the ESCRT-III subunits CHMP4A, B, and C were shown to be required for exosome secretion in breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells through a mechanism involving the interaction of Alix with syndecans-syntenin (Baietti et al., 2012). Finally, it was observed that the ESCRT-0 protein Hrs is required for the release of exosomes in dendritic cells (Tamai et al., 2010). On the other hand, a number of studies indicate that ESCRT components are dispensable for exosome secretion, suggesting the existence of ESCRT-independent mechanisms. For instance, the silencing of Hrs, tsg101, and Alix, as well as the overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Vps4 had no effect on intraluminal sorting or exosomal release of the proteolipid protein in mouse oligodendroglial Oli-neu cells (Trajkovic et al., 2008). Hrs was also shown to be dispensable for sorting of the pigment cell-specific protein 17 into melanosomal ILV in MNT-1 melanoma cells (Theos et al., 2006)\n",
      "Tetraspanin-mediated sorting\n",
      "The tetraspanin protein family consists of 33 members in humans. Tetraspanins have low sequence homology but are similarly structured in four transmembrane domains with both amino- and carboxyl-termini of the molecule oriented toward the cytoplasm. Tetraspanins interact with themselves and with other membrane and cytosolic proteins to organize a particular kind of membrane domains known as tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEM). Tetraspanins mediate a number of cellular processes including cell adhesion, immune activation, tumor and immune cell extravasation, virus entry and intracellular trafficking regulation (Yáñez et al., 2009; Charrin et al., 2014). TEM appear to play a role in sorting the intraluminal cargo and the secretion of exosomes. In dendritic cells, the loading of MHC-II in exosomes depends on its incorporation into membrane domains enriched in the tetraspanin CD9 (Buschow et al., 2009), and this protein was also shown to be required for the incorporation of the metalloprotease CD10 into exosomes of erythroleukemic K562 cells (Mazurov et al., 2013). Bone marrow dendritic cells derived from CD9 knockout mice show reduced secretion of exosomes, while the overexpression of tetraspanins CD9 or CD82 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells increases the incorporation of β-catenin in exosomes (Chairoungdua et al., 2010). In melanocytes the sorting of the luminal domain of pigment cell-specific protein 17 also depends on the expression of CD63 to be included into ILV during melanosome formation (van Niel et al., 2011)\n",
      "Lipid-mediated sorting\n",
      "The ability of lipids to laterally segregate and self-organize into specific membrane subdomains allows sorting platforms to be organized on cell membranes, including the limiting membrane of MVE (Bissig and Gruenberg, 2013). Accordingly, a subset of lipids and lipid-metabolizing enzymes has been implicated in the sorting of cargo into ILV as well as in exosome release. Cholesterol is a sterol lipid that plays a key role in organizing the biophysical properties of cell membranes (Maxfield and van Meer, 2010). Cholesterol was shown to be necessary for the formation of highly curved membrane structures such as caveolae (Chang et al., 1992) and synaptic vesicles (Thiele et al., 2000). Since cholesterol is highly enriched in ILV of MVE but poorly represented in lysosomes, a role for cholesterol was proposed in the intraluminal sorting of membranes destined for secretion as exosomes (Möbius et al., 2003). Lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) is a coned-shaped lipid that is also abundant in internal membranes of MVE (Kobayashi et al., 1998). LBPA controls the formation of ILV both in vitro and in vivo through the recruitment of Alix (Matsuo et al., 2004). However, since LBPA mostly concentrates in lysosomes and is present in only small amounts in exosomes, it was proposed that LBPA is not involved in the formation of ILV with a secretory destination but rather in backfusion of ILV with the MVE limiting membrane (Bissig and Gruenberg, 2014). Ceramide, another coned-shaped lipid, promotes the coalescence of membrane domains and induces the spontaneous curvature of membranes (Castro et al., 2014). The activity of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMNase) II, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of ceramide from sphingomyelin, is required for the inward budding of proteolipid protein-bearing ILV as well as for its secretion in exosomes in oligodendroglial Oli-neu cells, while it is not involved in the luminal sorting of epidermal growth factor receptor (Trajkovic et al., 2008), which follows the degradative pathway. Phospholipase D, which is required for the secretion of exosomes in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells (Laulagnier et al., 2004), is one more example of lipid-metabolizing enzyme involved in exosome biogenesis\n",
      "Biogenesis of exosomes by T cells\n",
      "There is little information regarding the cellular machinery that controls exosome biogenesis in T cells. In exosomes from human lymphoblasts, tetraspanins and their associated proteins form a network of interactions that comprise 45% of the total protein content (Perez-Hernandez et al., 2013). In mice deficient in tetraspanin CD81, these exosomes have a reduced content of CD81-associated proteins, such as B-cell receptor, CD20, ICAM-1, and HLA isotypes (Perez-Hernandez et al., 2013). These observations indicate a role for TEM in sorting of specific proteins to ILV destined for exosome secretion. The association of the oncogene latent membrane protein 1 of Epstein Barr virus with tetraspanin CD63-enriched microdomains is required for its sorting into ILV and its secretion via B cell exosomes, as demonstrated by CD63 silencing (Verweij et al., 2011). Although the evidence is still preliminary, the role of tetraspanins in protein sorting to ILV and their ubiquitous presence in exosomes make it plausible that tetraspanins, and subsequently TEM, also play a role in exosome biogenesis in T cells. As occurs in Oli-neu cells (Trajkovic et al., 2008), ceramide is important for the formation of ILV destined for exosomes in T cells, as silencing of nSMNase II or inhibition of its enzymatic activity induce a decrease in the release of exosomes (Mittelbrunn et al., 2011; Ventimiglia et al., 2015). Some lipid-metabolizing enzymes, such as diacylglycerol kinase α, accumulate on the limiting membrane of T cell MVE and control the maturation of MVE and the release of CD63-containing exosomes in T and B cells (Alonso et al., 2011), reinforcing the proposed role of lipids in exosome formation by T cells. A role for condensed membranes in exosome formation by T cells is further supported by the observation that T cell-derived-exosomes are enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol, as observed in a recent lipidomic analysis (Bosque et al., 2016). The observations that neither Hrs nor tsg101 are required for exosome release by T cells (Mittelbrunn et al., 2011; Ventimiglia et al., 2015) indicate that, although other ESCRT components have not been tested yet, exosome biogenesis appears to be independent of ESCRT machinery unlike in other cell types (Géminard et al., 2004; Baietti et al., 2012; Colombo et al., 2013)\n",
      "MAL is a 17-kDa tetraspanning membrane protein whose expression is restricted to T cells, specific polarized epithelia and myelin-forming cells (Alonso and Weissman, 1987). A characteristic biochemical feature of MAL is its exclusive association with detergent-insoluble membrane fractions enriched in condensed membranes (Millán and Alonso, 1998). MAL is essential for the transport of the tyrosine kinase Lck to the plasma membrane of T cells, and controls the condensation of membranes at the immunological synapse, ensuring the correct sorting of Lck and LAT into this structure (Antón et al., 2008, 2011). The membrane trafficking processes characterized so far are dependent on protein machinery. Lipids collaborate in these processes by helping to bend membranes to form transport vesicles (e.g., ceramide, LBPA) or by providing sites for recruiting specific protein machinery (e.g., phosphoinositides). An important clue about the cellular machinery involved in sorting of cargo and the biogenesis of exosomes in T cells, as well as about the mechanisms that regulate the collaboration between TEM and condensed membranes comes from the study of the role of the protein MAL during MVE maturation and the secretion of exosomes in T cells (Ventimiglia et al., 2015). MAL distributes in tubular-vesicular structures characteristic of early endosomes, some of which present MVE morphology. The silencing of MAL in T cells reduces the number of exosomes secreted, and subsequently the release of the exosome cargo. This effect was correlated with reduced sorting of CD63 into the intraluminal space of MVE and its accumulation on the limiting membrane of aberrant MVE that no longer fuse with the plasma membrane but, instead, merge with autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes. Therefore, the protein MAL appears as a key component of the machinery responsible for exosome biogenesis and sorting of cargo, including tetraspanins, destined for exosome delivery in T cells. The role of MAL in Lck trafficking, organization of the immunological synapse and exosome biogenesis is probably related to the capacity of MAL to organize condensed membrane domains (Antón et al., 2008, 2011; Magal et al., 2009)\n",
      "From a biochemical point of view exosomes could be considered to be specialized membranes highly enriched in TEM and condensed domains. Although these two distinctive membrane domains are biochemically and functionally distinguishable entities (Le Naour et al., 2006), it has been demonstrated that the progression of many cellular processes rely on the ability of TEM and condensed membranes to cooperate in order to build functional membrane scaffolds. There are a number of examples that illustrate a relationship between condensed membranes and TEM that are consistent with a possible joint role of these two types of membrane in exosome biogenesis. For example, the incorporation of the B-cell receptor into condensed membranes, a key step to ensure the sustainment and the amplification of B-cell receptor-mediated signaling, depends on the expression of CD81 (Cherukuri et al., 2004); in T cells the tetraspanin CD82 mediates the association of the actin cytoskeleton with compact membranes, which is necessary for triggering T-cell receptor-dependent signaling (Delaguillaumie et al., 2004); the incorporation of CD9 into condensed membranes domains is crucial for the cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis (Ishii et al., 2006); and the recruitment of CD63 to filopodia tips during the adhesion of platelets depends on the membrane compaction (Heijnen et al., 2003). In this regard, the cooperation between TEM and condensed membranes could have a key importance during the biogenesis of exosomes, firstly mediating the organization of differentiated domains on the limiting membrane of MVE through the recruitment of specific exosome components, and then, promoting the invagination of these domains to form ILV. Supporting a collaboration between condensed membranes and TEM, it was reported that β-catenin secretion in exosomes of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells is impaired in CD9 knockout mice and also by nSMNase II inhibition (Chairoungdua et al., 2010). Despite these advances, the mechanisms that regulate the interaction between TEM and condensed membranes require further investigations. Given the capacity of MAL to organize condensed membrane domains (Antón et al., 2008, 2011; Magal et al., 2009), the presence of ceramide in this type of membrane and the dependence of the exosome secretion of CD63 on both ceramide and MAL expression, it is plausible that the correct intraluminal sorting of CD63 to secretory MVE requires MAL-organized ceramide patches at the MVE limiting membrane to promote cargo selection and the inward invagination of the patches leading to the formation of ILV for exosome secretion (Figure 2)\n",
      "Figure 2 Model of MAL function in exosome biogenesis by T cells. (A) The transmembrane protein MAL facilitates the incorporation of TEM into ceramide-enriched condensed nanodomains at the limiting membrane of MVE. The intraluminal budding of the TEM-condensed mixed nanodomains gives rise to the ILV that are released as exosomes. Although MAL also intervenes in other membrane trafficking processes, only those related to exosome biogenesis are represented. (B) In MAL-silenced T cells, TEM are not incorporated efficiently into ILV and accumulate on the limiting membrane of MVE. These aberrant MVE are not able to fuse with the plasma membrane and divert to lysosomes for degradation\n",
      "Function of T cell-derived exosomes\n",
      "Although a large number of proteins are commonly found in exosomes regardless of their cellular origin (Choi et al., 2015), the protein composition of exosomes varies with cell type, somehow reflecting the specific functions of the producer cell. For instance, exosomes derived from B cells carry B-cell receptor subunits (Rialland et al., 2006) and those released by natural killer cells contain the cytolitic protein perforin and CD56 (Lugini et al., 2012), which is a marker of this type of cell. Consistent with this correlation, normal T cells secrete exosomes containing T-cell receptor subunits, Src-like tyrosine kinases and adhesion molecules (Blanchard et al., 2002)\n",
      "With regard to the function of exosomes secreted by T cells, diacylglycerol kinase α inhibition is known to increase the secretion of lethal exosomes bearing membrane-associated Fas ligand to mediate activation-induced cell death in other T cells (Alonso et al., 2005). The exosomes derived from stimulated human CD3+ T cells cooperate with IL2 in promoting proliferation of autologous resting cells (Wahlgren et al., 2012). T-cell tolerance of allergic cutaneous contact sensitivity induced in mice is shown due to exosomes secreted by CD8+ suppressor T cells (Bryniarski et al., 2013). Also, in mice, Fas ligand-containing exosomes secreted by activated T cells promote tumor invasion in lungs by increasing the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Cai et al., 2012), and CD8+CD45+ regulatory T cell-released exosomes inhibit CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response and antitumor activity (Zhang et al., 2011). The exosomes secreted by CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells prolong the survival time of kidney transplants and inhibit T cell proliferation in rat models, indicating that exosomes contribute to transplantation tolerance (Yu et al., 2013)\n",
      "Similar to the case of exosomes from other sources (Valadi et al., 2007; Kosaka et al., 2010), exosomes secreted by human T cells deliver biologically active miRNA (Mittelbrunn et al., 2011). miRNA can be unidirectionally transferred from T cells to antigen-presenting cells through the immunological synapse using exosomes as vehicles (Mittelbrunn et al., 2011). The importance of exosome miRNA in modulating the immune response is revealed by the observation that Let-7d miRNA, which is found in exosomes derived from Foxp3+ T regulatory cells, suppresses T helper 1 cells proliferation and γ-IFN secretion (Okoye et al., 2014)\n",
      "In addition to their role in controlling the immune response, exosomes play a role in pathogenesis, with some pathogens being able to modulate the secretion of exosomes in the host to favor its own propagation. For example, the expression of the HIV-1 protein Nef induces the secretion of exosomes either in HIV-1 infected or in Nef-transfected T cells (Campbell et al., 2008; Muratori et al., 2009; Lenassi et al., 2010; Raymond et al., 2011; Shelton et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2013). It has been shown that HIV-1 usurps the exosome-based intercellular communication network of T cells to render quiescent T cells permissive to HIV-1 replication (Arenaccio et al., 2014a,b) promoting their apoptosis (Lenassi et al., 2010) and stimulating an extensive secretory activity leading to the massive release of microvesicles (Muratori et al., 2009)\n",
      "Conclusions\n",
      "Exosomes secreted by T cells have emerged as key mediators of the immune response, modulating the activity of immune cells. Modulation of the exosome route in T cells, therefore, may be of therapeutic value for preventing T cell-mediated diseases such as inflammation or transplant rejection or for interfering with the progression of HIV-1 infection (Agarwal et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; De Toro et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Sáenz-Cuesta et al., 2015). Ceramide, tetraspanins and MAL, which have been revealed to be important in exosome biogenesis by T cells, are candidate molecular targets for artificially modulating exosome production by T cells. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms that regulate the release of exosomes in these cells becomes fundamental not only to gain more insight into the roles of these vesicles during the onset and progression of a robust immune response, but also to enable the design of engineered exosomes for use as therapeutic agents\n",

If left untreated, BCCs can become locally aggressive or even metastasize. Currently available treatments include local destruction, surgery, and radiation. Systemic options for advanced disease are limited. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is aberrantly activated in a majority of BCCs and in other cancers. Hh pathway inhibitors are targeted agents that inhibit the aberrant activation of the Hh pathway, with smoothened being a targeted component. Sonidegib is a novel smoothened inhibitor that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.

      "Introduction\n",
      "Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common nonmelanoma skin cancer.1 BCCs can occur sporadically or in familial genetic syndromes where patients harbor a mutation in key regulatory genes. When left untreated, BCCs can become locally aggressive and may metastasize, limiting the efficacy of standard treatment. Much attention has been given to targeted Hedgehog pathway inhibition (HPI) as a means to treat advanced BCC: locally advanced lesions that are deemed inappropriate for surgery or radiation or metastatic lesions. To date, only two Hedgehog (Hh) pathway inhibitor agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): vismodegib and sonidegib. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad introduction to the molecular mechanisms underlying BCC pathogenesis and the role of sonidegib, a targeted smoothened inhibitor, in modulating the natural history of advanced BCC\n",
      "Clinical features of BCCs\n",
      "Approximately 750,000 BCCs are detected each year, and BCC is the fifth most costly cancer among Medicare patients.2,3 BCC often appears with characteristic features of a slow growing papule that often heals slowly after a minor trauma, although many clinical variants exist. With time, they can ulcerate and continue to grow without detection by the patient. BCCs tend to occur more often in men than in women and more frequently in patients aged >50 years. These tumors are typically associated with a history of increased sun exposure, although it is uncertain whether extensive sun exposure or intermittent cumulative sun exposure is most associated with this cancer.4\n",
      "BCCs also occur in genetically susceptible individuals. Patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS or Gorlin syndrome) have a propensity early in life to spontaneously develop multiple BCCs. Additionally, these patients have other clinical features including palmar pitting, odontogenic cysts, calcification of the falx cerebri, midline craniofacial abnormalities, and an increased risk in some other neoplasms, including medulloblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, meningiomas, and ovarian fibromas.5 Given the larger number of developing lesions, these patients often receive multiple treatment modalities for their BCCs\n",
      "Most BCCs are effectively treated with local destruction or surgical management such as Mohs micrographic surgery or wide local excision. Less commonly, small lesions may be treated with cryotherapy, electrodessication and curettage, or topical agents, including 5-fluoruracil cream or the immunomodulator imiquimod\n",
      "While BCC is the most common and easily treated skin cancer, metastases are rare. Risk factors associated with locally advanced or metastatic disease include clinical size >2.5 cm, high-risk anatomic location (central portion of the face or ears), long-standing duration, incomplete excision, aggressive histology, and perineural or perivascular involvement.6 Metastases occur most commonly when the primary tumor occurs on the face, with metastases first to the regional lymph nodes, followed by bone, lung, or liver.6 Systemic chemotherapy and radiation have been employed to treat metastatic BCC (metBCC) with very limited success.7–10 Additionally, advanced BCC can be disfiguring and emotionally distressing to patients, which can limit their perception of receiving adequate care during therapy. With the advent of targeted smoothened inhibitors, patients now have more treatment options available to them\n",
      "The molecular basis of BCC pathogenesis\n",
      "The pathogenesis of BCC has been elucidated including identification of aberrant Hh pathway signaling and associated mutations in the Patched (PTCH) and smoothened (SMO) genes.11 Hahn et al12 demonstrated that BCNS patients harbored a germline mutation in the PTCH gene. PTCH was subsequently mapped to chromosome 9q22.3 and is homologous to the Drosophila patched gene, which mediates midline development.13 Furthermore, >50%–60% of spontaneous cutaneous BCCs possess PTCH mutations.14 Given these findings, it was proposed that BCC is a disease of aberrant Hh pathway signaling.14\n",
      "PTCH, as originally described, is now designated as PTCH1. PTCH2, a closely related homolog, located on chromosome 1p32, has been discovered and is mutated in some cases of BCNS and meduloblastomas.15\n",
      "Hh signaling pathway\n",
      "Hh signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that is necessary in embryonic development mediating organogenesis and midline development. Given its importance in development, this pathway is tightly regulated – alterations of which have been found in many cancers. The Hh ligands are sonic Hh (Shh), Indian Hh (Ihh), and desert Hh (Dhh). Other major components of the pathway include PTCH1/2, smoothened, and GLI. In the absence of the Hh ligand, PTCH1/2 is constitutively bound to and inhibits the intracellular protein smoothened. In canonical Hh signaling, the Hh ligand binds to and inhibits PTCH1/2, in turn freeing smoothened to activate downstream GLI transcription factors (Figure 1).16,17 Consequently, abnormal activation of this pathway promotes tumorigenesis and is etiologic in a majority of sporadic and familial BCCs. Loss-of-function mutations in PTCH1 or PTCH2 or activating mutations in SMO are seen in at least 70% of sporadic BCCs.18–20 This mode of Hh pathway activation is referred to as mutation-dependent activation\n",
      "Conversely, other cancer types including pancreatic, lung, and breast have demonstrated a ligand-dependent mode of aberrant Hh signaling where either tumor or stromal cells secrete Hh ligand.21–25 Given the relevance of this pathway in many solid cancers, specific HPI could potentially modulate tumor progression in a wide variety of cancer types\n",
      "Hh pathway inhibition\n",
      "In 1965, scientists at the Poisonous Plant Research Laboratory of the US Department of Agriculture reported that pregnant ewes grazing on the corn lily, Veratrum californicum, produced cyclopic sheep.26 The toxin causing the cyclopic defect was isolated from V. californicum and named cyclopamine.27,28 Subsequently, two separate groups established that cyclopamine inhibits the Hh signaling pathway.29,30 Cyclopamine possesses anticancer activity in cell culture and animal studies; however, cyclopamine has limited bioavailability due to low water solubility and instability under acidic conditions, which may limit its clinical utility.31–35 Cyclopamine derivatives have been developed to circumvent these limitations and the cyclopamine derivative IPI-926 has demonstrated some clinical activity in BCC patients in a Phase I dose-finding study.36–38 Clinical and preclinical studies have also investigated other HPIs including GANT58, GANT61, HPI1-4, and robotnikinin, which inhibit other components of the Hh pathway.39–41 Itraconazole, an antifungal agent, has also shown some clinical activity against advanced BCC alone and in combination with arsenic trioxide.42,43\n",
      "To date, two HPIs have been approved by the FDA: vismodegib and sonidegib. These currently available HPIs specifically function by inhibition of Smo, thus inhibiting aberrant Smo activation found in a majority of BCCs. Clinical trials currently underway are investigating the clinical benefits of HPI in various human cancers (Table 1)\n",
      "Regarding the treatment of advanced BCC, sonidegib (Odomzo®; Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) is a novel Smo antagonist that is approved in the US and European Union for locally advanced BCC (laBCC) that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy or for patients who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy. In Switzerland and Australia, sonidegib is approved for adult patients with locally advanced and metBCC.44\n",
      "Sonidegib was first identified in 2010 as compound LDE225 while screening biphenyl carboxamides that displayed potent HPI and antitumor activity in a medulloblastoma allograft model.45 In this study, sonidegib possessed Smo inhibition with high tissue penetration, good oral bioavailability, and the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier\n",
      "Early clinical studies of sonidegib\n",
      "A subsequent open-label, dose-escalated Phase I trial of sonidegib in advanced solid tumors demonstrated activity against medulloblastoma and advanced BCC.46 This study investigated doses ranging from 100 mg to 3,000 mg once daily and from 250 mg to 750 mg twice daily. The maximum tolerated dose was 800 mg daily and 250 mg twice daily. Common Grade 1/2 adverse effects (AEs) noted in this study include nausea, dysgeusia (abnormal sensation of taste), anorexia, vomiting, myalgias, muscle spasms, fatigue, alopecia, and increased serum creatine kinase (CK). Grade 3/4 AEs included weight loss, myalgia, hyperbilirubinemia, dizziness, and fatigue. Of note, reversible Grade 3/4 CK elevation was considered dose limiting in 19 patients (18%) at doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose and was reported to occur 3–6 weeks after initiating the drug in an exposure-dependent manner. In most cases, the CK elevation was associated with myalgia. Importantly, six of 16 BCC patients in this trial (37.5%) achieved an objective tumor response (defined as partial or complete response, CR) according to RECIST criteria and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging studies\n",
      "A topical preparation of sonidegib was also investigated for the treatment of sporadic superficial and nodular BCC. Although there was initial enthusiasm about the potential for this topical preparation, a Phase II trial was terminated early due to insufficient efficacy using the formulation evaluated.47 Another topical HPI tested in the Phase I setting, CUR61414, did not demonstrate clinical efficacy, which may have been due to inadequate drug concentrations, low penetration, or rapid clearance.48\n",
      "A recent trial demonstrated little clinical efficacy of sonidegib in BCC patients whose disease was stable progressed on vismodegib. In this trial, nine patients were enrolled although four patients discontinued. Of the five evaluable patients, three had metastatic disease that is notoriously difficult to treat with any modality. Of the two locally advanced patients, one had a treatment duration of only 3 weeks, and the other patient had a treatment duration of 6 weeks, which may preclude adequate evaluation of sonidegib efficacy. Given these limitations, the study authors suggest that patients whose BCCs are resistant to vismodegib may progress on another Smo inhibitor. Since both vismodegib and sonidegib inhibit smoothened within the binding pocket, there is potential to develop novel therapies at other sites of smoothened or to inhibit other components of the Hh pathway.49 Buonamici demonstrated in a mouse xenograft model of medulloblastoma that was resistant to sonidegib that concomitant inhibition of Hh pathway and the IGF-R/PI3K/Akt pathway may overcome resistance to sonidegib. This mechanism is not yet fully understood and provides potential avenues for further drug targets.50\n",
      "While no head-to-head trials exist in comparing sonidegib with vismodegib, another FDA-approved HPI, it is interesting to note that both drugs have unique dose responses. In a Phase I trial of vismodegib, there were no observed dose-related responses – plasma concentration of vismodegib remained relatively constant despite escalating doses. This observation is thought to be due to high plasma protein binding.51,52 In a Phase I study, sonidegib demonstrated a dose-related response rate based on pharmacokinetic and molecular studies although it is unclear if this is due to altered plasma protein binding.46 Because of these differing dose responses, one might hypothesize that patients may experience a more sustained response once steady state is achieved with sonidegib\n",
      "Basal cell carcinoma outcomes trial\n",
      "The pivotal Phase II study demonstrating clinical benefit with sonidegib for the treatment of BCCs was the Basal cell carcinoma Outcomes in LDE225 Treatment (BOLT) trial. This study was an international randomized, double-blind Phase II trial evaluating two doses of sonidegib in 230 patients with metBCC or laBCC not amenable to local therapy. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio and were treated with either 800 mg (n=151) or 200 mg (n=79) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Other patient characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The 200 mg dose previously showed exposure in the predictive range with acceptable antitumor activity and the 800 mg dose was the highest well-tolerated dose in a once-daily regimen. Tumor response was assessed by a central review committee and by study investigators using two methods: RECIST Version 1.1 criteria for patients with metBCC, which is based on MRI assessment and by modified RECIST (mRECIST) to assess patients with laBCC.53 mRECIST is a stringent composite multimodal evaluation, which integrates MRI data according to RECIST 1.1, standard and annotated color photography according to WHO criteria, and histology in multiple biopsies based on lesion surface area. mRECIST is a more thorough method used to assess locally advanced disease in the setting of potential ulceration, cyst formation, scarring, fibrosis, and ill-defined lesion borders that may occur with treatment. Using the stringent mRECIST criteria, in order to qualify as a CR, a CR (or equivalent) must be demonstrated in all modalities: MRI, bidimensional measurements from standard and annotated photography, and all multiple surveying biopsies being reported as negative\n",
      "The primary end point of BOLT was the objective response rate (ORR) determined by central review in patients with laBCC and metBCC. Key secondary end points in the study were duration of response (DoR) and CR rate determined by central review. Other secondary end points were ORR and DoR as determined by investigator review, the time to tumor response, duration of progression-free survival (PFS) as determined by central and investigator review, and safety. Objective response (OR) encompassed both CR and partial response (PR). Complete response for this study was defined as complete disappearance of all lesions and all negative surveying biopsies obtained from two or more sites as assessed by a single independent review panel. PR was defined as achieving at least a 50% reduction in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of locally advanced target lesions based on photography and at least a 30% reduction in the sum of longest diameters of all target lesions assessable by MRI. Response of metastatic disease was based on standard RECIST 1.1 criteria. The median duration of treatment was 8.9 months in the 200 mg dose group and 6.5 months in the 800 mg dose group\n",
      "The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated an OR in 20 of 55 (36%, 95% CI 24–50) patients in the 200 mg dose group and 39 of 116 (34%, 25–43) patients in the 800 mg group meeting the study’s success criteria of accomplishing an ORR ≥30% in both treatment arms (laBCC and metBCC combined; Table 3). By central review, two patients with laBCC (3%) experienced a CR with 200 mg sonidegib; by investigator review, five patients experienced a CR with 200 mg sonidegib. In the laBCC treatment group, 76 patients achieved an OR, only seven (four in the 200 mg group and three in the 800 mg group) had disease progression or died before primary analysis cutoff. Durable responses lasting >6 months in patients with laBCC were seen in 12 of 31 (39%) patients in the 200 mg group and 17 of 45 (38%) of patients in the 800 mg group. Median PFS in the laBCC patients was not reached in either dose group as measured by central review. Median PFS by investigator review was reported to be 22 months with the 200 mg sonidegib dose but not reached with the 800 mg dose. The DoR by central review was not reached in either dosing; the DoR by investigator review was 20.2 months with the 200 mg dose but not reached with the 800 mg dose\n",
      "ORs lasting at least 6 months at the time of primary efficacy cutoff were seen in five of six patients with metBCC. No substantial differences in OR were found when comparing different subgroups stratified based on histology or geographical location. By central review, no patients with metBCC experienced a CR; by investigator review, two patients (9%) had a CR with 800 mg of sonidegib. In metBCC patients, the median PFS was 13.1 months in the 200 mg sonidegib dose group and 7.6 months in the 800 mg dose group by central review; the median PFS values were 13.1 months and 13.3 months by investigator review\n",
      "The most common AEs noted were muscle spasms, dysgeusia, alopecia, nausea, increased CK, weight decrease, and fatigue. These AEs were less frequent in the 200 mg sonidegib than in the 800 mg sonidegib group. Consequently, fewer AE-related dose interruptions, reductions, or treatment discontinuations were seen in the 200 mg group than in the 800 mg group. Serious AEs were reported in 14% of patients in the 200 mg sonidegib group and 30% in the 800 mg sonidegib group. Secondary malignancies were noted in 6% (200 mg) and 7% (800 mg) of patients. Four patients in the 800 mg group died while taking study treatment, but none of these deaths was deemed to be related to sonidegib. Owing to improved tolerability and similar efficacy between these two doses, it was concluded that the 200 mg sonidegib dosing offered a more favorable benefit-to-risk profile\n",
      "This study employed a PCR-based assessment of GLI1 expression as a marker of Hh pathway activation. The change in GLI1 expression was assessed from tumor biopsy samples obtained at the time of screening, at weeks 9, 17, and at the end of treatment. As expected, a sustained reduction in GLI1 expression was seen in patients with disease control (CR + PR + stable disease) confirming HPI\n",
      "The BOLT study also assessed the impact on patient-reported quality of life (QOL) because advanced BCC can lead to emotional or psychological stress, in turn impacting a patient’s QOL. Two questionnaires based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer were employed: the Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30) typically employed in oncology and the associated module for head and neck cancers, the H&N35. Prespecified relevant-to-advanced BCC subscales were selected from these QOL questionnaires. These included physical functioning, social functioning, pain, and fatigue for QLQ-C30, and trouble with social contact, head and neck pain, and weight loss for H&N35. These QOL data were collected up to 6 months after randomization of the last patient with a median follow-up of 13.9 months. In patients with laBCC, most responders had maintenance of or improvement in scores on both QLQ-C30 and H&N35 in both sonidegib dose arms. Similar QOL results were noted in metBCC as most patients had maintenance of or improvement in scores from baseline on both questionnaires. The BOLT study demonstrated a clear role of Smo inhibitors in the treatment of advanced BCC and a favorable benefit-to-risk profile was noted for most patients\n",
      "12-month follow-up of the BOLT trial\n",
      "The original BOLT study reported the results of the primary analysis with data collected up to 6 months after randomization of the last patient, with a median follow-up of 13.9 months. Efficacy and safety data 12 months following randomization of the last patient have also been presented.54 At the time of primary analysis, a total of 144 patients (63%) had discontinued the treatment primarily due to AEs and an additional 35 patients (77.8%) had discontinued the treatment in the 12-month follow-up\n",
      "The 12-month analysis demonstrated a higher ORR in both the 200 mg and the 800 mg arms, up to 11% (58% vs 47%) and 9% (44% vs 35%), respectively, for laBCC. Furthermore, 48 of 51 (92.3%) patients in the 200 mg arm and 91 of 101 (90.1%) patients in the 800 mg arm (91/101) demonstrated laBCC tumor shrinkage as analyzed by photography per WHO criteria, demonstrating a clear clinical benefit. Of the responders, 52.6% treated with 200 mg sonidegib and 53.6% treated with 800 mg sonidegib demonstrated a durable antitumor response of >6 months among 94 patients with laBCC, 18 patients (19.1%) had disease progression or died. Median PFS by central review was 22.1 months with the 200 mg dose group and 21.5 months with the 800 mg dose group; the respective median PFS by investigator review was 22.0 months and 21.5 months. The median DoR by central review was not reached with 200 mg because few responders progressed or died and was 15.7 months with the 800 mg; median DoR values by investigator review were 20.2 months and 19.8 months. A CR was observed in 4.5% of laBCC patients with 200 mg and 1.6% with 800 mg by central review; by investigator review, a CR was observed in 9.1% and 10.9% of patients, respectively. Efficacy of the metBCC subgroups in the 12-month analysis was similar to that in the primary analysis. The ORR by central review was 7.7% and 17.4% in the 200 mg and 800 mg arms, respectively. Tumor shrinkage was noted in 84.6% of patients treated with sonidegib 200 mg and 81.8% of patients treated with sonidegib 800 mg. Additionally, 92.3% and 91.3% in the 200 mg and 800 mg arms, respectively, experienced DC. Median PFS in metBCC patients was 13.1 months in the 200 mg and 11.1 months in the 800 mg by central review; respective PFS values as measured by investigator review for metBCC were 13.1 months and 14.3 months. Median DoR for metBCC was not reached as measured by central review at either dose; median DoR by investigator review was 17.7 months with the 200 mg and 10.2 months with the 800 mg. As measured by central review, no metBCC patients experienced a CR; by investigator review 8.7% of patients experienced a CR with 800 mg sonidegib\n",
      "The safety profile of sonidegib in the 12-month follow-up data was similar to the primary analysis data. As with the primary analysis, the most common AEs were muscle spasms, alopecia, dysgeusia, nausea, increased CK, and fatigue being the most common adverse events among the subjects. Approximately 97.5% of those in the 200 mg sonidegib group and 100% of those in the 800 mg sonidegib group experienced an AE. These events led 27.8% and 37.3% of patients in the 200 mg and 800 mg arms, respectively, to discontinue study medication. The 12-month follow-up data also showed that 91.1% of the sonidegib 200 mg patients and 70.0% of the sonidegib 800 mg patients remained on treatment for at least 4 months\n",
      "At the time of the 12-month analysis, three additional deaths occurred since the primary analysis and none were associated with treatment-related AEs. A low percentage of patients (1.3% in the 200 mg sonidegib and 3.3% in the 800 mg sonidegib group) were reported to have had a CK elevation (at least a tenfold from baseline). These findings, however, were not confirmed by the independent safety review and adjudication committee on muscle toxicity as rhabdomyolysis (defined as a tenfold increase in CK above baseline plus a serum creatinine elevation of at least 1.5-fold above baseline) owing to normal renal function\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Patients with advanced BCC have limited options and the condition is considered difficult to treat at best. As our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying BCC improves, targeted therapies will continue to play an important role in the treatment of advanced BCC. The BOLT trial demonstrated that sonidegib had a durable clinical benefit for patients whose disease was not controlled or amenable to treatment through surgery or radiation. QOL for these patients is an important consideration and QOL measures assessed by BOLT indicated that most patients experienced stable or improved QOL. The 12-month analysis of safety and efficacy confirmed the antitumor effect seen in the primary analysis with similar safety data. BOLT study investigators suggest that future therapeutic options may include sonidegib in combination with other treatment modalities to accomplish tumor control. Further studies would be needed to investigate which options are best for patients with advanced BCC\n",

MEK5-ERK5 pathway has been associated to different cellular processes, playing a crucial role in cell proliferation in normal and cancer cells by mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of its kinase activity. Thus, nuclear ERK5 activates transcription factors by either direct phosphorylation or acting as co-activator thanks to a unique transcriptional activation TAD domain located at its C-terminal tail. Consequently, ERK5 has been proposed as an interesting target to tackle different cancers, and either inhibitors of ERK5 activity or silencing the protein have shown antiproliferative activity in cancer cells and to block tumor growth in animal models. Here, we review the different mechanisms involved in ERK5 nuclear translocation and their consequences. Inactive ERK5 resides in the cytosol, forming a complex with Hsp90-Cdc37 superchaperone. In a canonical mechanism, MEK5-dependent activation results in ERK5 C-terminal autophosphorylation, Hsp90 dissociation, and nuclear translocation. This mechanism integrates signals such as growth factors and stresses that activate the MEK5-ERK5 pathway. Importantly, two other mechanisms, MEK5-independent, have been recently described. These mechanisms allow nuclear shuttling of kinase-inactive forms of ERK5. Although lacking kinase activity, these forms activate transcription by interacting with transcription factors through the TAD domain. Both mechanisms also require Hsp90 dissociation previous to nuclear translocation. One mechanism involves phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of ERK5 by kinases that are activated during mitosis, such as Cyclin-dependent kinase-1. The second mechanism involves overexpression of chaperone Cdc37, an oncogene that is overexpressed in cancers such as prostate adenocarcinoma, where it collaborates with ERK5 to promote cell proliferation. Although some ERK5 kinase inhibitors have shown antiproliferative activity it is likely that those tumors expressing kinase-inactive nuclear ERK5 will not respond to these inhibitors\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Extracellular signal-re gulated kinase 5 (ERK5, also named big MAP kinase 1, Bmk1) is a member of the Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). ERK5 is ubiquitously expressed throughout all mammalian tissues and cell lines (Lee et al., 1995; Zhou et al., 1995; Buschbeck and Ullrich, 2005), where it is activated in response to several growth factors and oxidative and hyperosmotic stress (Kato et al., 2000). ERK5 is twice the size of the classical MAPKs (816 aa for human ERK5), containing an N-terminal kinase domain (aa 78–406) and a unique C-terminal tail (aa 410–816) with no homology to any other protein, which has an autoinhibitory function (Buschbeck and Ullrich, 2005). This C-terminal tail contains a myocyte enhancer factor 2 MEF2-interacting region (aa 440–501, Kasler et al., 2000), a bipartite nuclear localization signal NLS (aa 505–539), and a transcriptional activation domain (TAD, aa 664–789, Kasler et al., 2000), which associates with and activates several transcription factors (Morimoto et al., 2007; Woo et al., 2010). Activation of ERK5 requires dual phosphorylation of a Threonine and Tyrosine residues within a TEY motif in the activation loop of the kinase domain (Mody et al., 2003). MEK5 is the only kinase that activates ERK5, and it has a unique specificity for ERK5, not phosphorylating any other MAPKs: MEK5 knockout mice dye at early stages of embryo development, showing similar defects in cardiac development and angiogenesis as those reported for ERK5 knockout mice (Wang et al., 2005)\n",
      "Role of ERK5 pathway in normal and cancer cell proliferation\n",
      "ERK5 plays a crucial role in cell proliferation. First evidences reported that ERK5 activation is required for EGF-dependent proliferation in HeLa cells (Kato et al., 1998), by inducing transcription of c-jun (an essential component in cell proliferation) through the transcriptional activation of MEF2C (Kato et al., 1997). Since then, several authors have shown activation of ERK5 in response to other mitogenic factors, such as Nerve growth factor (NGF, Shao et al., 2002), Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, Dong et al., 2001), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF, Kesavan et al., 2004), or Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, Rovida et al., 2008)\n",
      "ERK5 regulates cell cycle progression, being necessary for G1/S transition. In this regard, ERK5 inhibition prevents cells from entering the S phase of the cell cycle (Kato et al., 1998) by stabilizing the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27 (Perez-Madrigal et al., 2012). In human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, activation of ERK5 promotes c-Myc-dependent transcriptional activation of miR-17-5p and miR-20a, resulting in blockade of p21 mRNA translation (Perez-Madrigal et al., 2012). ERK5 also mediates in G1/S transition by regulating expression of cyclin D1. Activation of MEK5/ERK5 pathway induces transcription of Cyclin D1, resulting in cell cycle progression in G1. Conversely, ERK5 inhibition diminishes serum-induced Cyclin D1 protein levels (Mulloy et al., 2003). Additionally, ERK5 is also implicated in G2/M transition. ERK5 is activated at G2/M, it is required for timely mitotic entry, and constitutively active ERK5 increases the mitotic index (Cude et al., 2007; Girio et al., 2007). The mitotic entry induced by ERK5 depends on the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, which upregulates mitosis-promoting genes such as cyclins B1 and B2, and cdc25B (Cude et al., 2007). During mitosis, active ERK5 prevents caspase activation by binding and inactivating the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, suggesting that active ERK5 contributes to cell survival in mitosis (Girio et al., 2007). The role of ERK5 in controlling cell survival and differentiation, as well as angiogenesis, has been already covered in excellent reviews (Wang and Tournier, 2006; Drew et al., 2012; Lochhead et al., 2012; Nithianandarajah-Jones et al., 2012)\n",
      "During the last years, different laboratories have shown that the MEK5-ERK5 pathway plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation. For instance, overexpression of either MEK5 or ERK5 in prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells results in increased proliferation index (McCracken et al., 2008; Erazo et al., 2013). Consequently, ERK5 kinase inhibitors (such as the XMD8-92 compound) or ERK5 silencing show antiproliferative activity in different cancer cell lines and block tumor growth in animal models (human tumor xenografts). Table 1 summarizes the different human cancers where it has been reported an effect of ERK5 silencing/inhibition on cell proliferation and/or tumor growth. Importantly, there are increasing evidences pointing to an important role of nuclear ERK5 in cancer, both in vitro (cell lines) and in vivo (mouse models). For instance, there is a strong correlation between nuclear ERK5 and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Expression of nuclear ERK5 is upregulated in prostate cancers showing high-grade Gleason and bone metastasis (McCracken et al., 2008; Clape et al., 2009; Ramsay et al., 2011; Ahmad et al., 2013). However, and as explained below, ERK5 can promote cell proliferation independently of its kinase activity, acting as a moonlighting protein. For instance, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors show increased nuclear ERK5, which does not correlate with an increase on ERK5 kinase activity (Rovida et al., 2015). Also, ERK5 localizes at the nucleus of CLB-BAR and CLB-GE human neuroblastoma cell lines, even in the presence of the ERK5 inhibitor XMD8-92 (Umapathy et al., 2014). These findings suggest that nuclear ERK5 expression, instead of ERK5 phosphorylation, might be used as prognostic biomarker of some cancers\n",

      "ERK5 nuclear substrates\n",
      "The best characterized ERK5 substrates are nuclear transcriptional factors, whereas very few ERK5 cytosolic substrates have been characterized so far. Although ERK5 silencing affects the phosphorylation state of cytosolic proteins such as Akt and p90RSK kinases or the pro-apoptotic protein BAD, this is controversial since a direct ERK5 phosphorylation of these proteins has not been shown. For instance, Ranganathan et al. described that ERK5 phosphorylates p90RSK in vitro (Ranganathan et al., 2006), but other authors have shown that the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 blocks p90RSK activation in response to EGF, at concentrations that do not block ERK5 activity (Mody et al., 2001). The use of the new synthesized specific ERK5 inhibitors—such as the XMD8-92 compound—will help to address these controversies\n",
      "ERK5 phosphorylates the transcription factor Sap1, a member of ternary complex factors (TCFs). ERK5-mediated Sap1 phosphorylation activates transcription through the Serum Response Element (SRE), which induces the expression of c-Fos (Kamakura et al., 1999). Although a direct phosphorylation by ERK5 has not been shown, co-expression of ERK5 and catalytically active MEK5 in COS-7 cells induces phosphorylation and stabilization of c-Fos and Fra-1 transcription factors (Terasawa et al., 2003). Activation of the ERK5 pathway results in phosphorylation of few Ser/Thr residues in c-Fos and Fra-1, generating more stable proteins and enhanced transactivation activity of these factors (Terasawa et al., 2003)\n",
      "The three members of the MEF2 (myocyte enhancer factor-2) family of transcription factors MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D are the best characterized ERK5 substrates. MEF2 proteins regulate cell differentiation in myocytes and neurons (Potthoff and Olson, 2007), and act as a nodal point for stress-response in adult tissues (Kim et al., 2008). An interaction of MEF2C with ERK5 has been shown in two hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation assays. To our knowledge, MEF2C is the only nuclear protein whose interaction with ERK5 has been mapped. MEF2C interacts with a region of the C-terminal tail of ERK5 (aa 440–501) through its N-terminal end (Yang et al., 1998; Kasler et al., 2000). More importantly, activation of ERK5 pathway by either serum or EGF stimulates the transactivation activity of the MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D transcription factors. Furthermore, ERK5 seems to be determinant for EGF-stimulated activation of MEF2A and MEF2D, since expression of ERK5 dominant negative mutant abolishes this activation (Kato et al., 2000). ERK5 phosphorylates different sites in MEF2A, MEF2C, and MEF2D proteins, however many of these residues are conserved in all three members, suggesting the existence of additional structural determinants to achieve recognition of the phosphorylated sites. Thus, ERK5 phosphorylates Thr312, Thr319, and S355 in MEF2A, Ser386/7 in MEF2C, and Ser179 and in MEF2D, and mutation to alanine of these residues abrogates MEF2 transcriptional activity (Kato et al., 1997, 2000)\n",
      "The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a transcription factor that acts as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting proliferation and inducing cellular senescence and apoptosis through activation of the CDK inhibitor p21 (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007). Yang et al. have shown that ERK5 interacts with PML at the nuclear bodies in cancer cells, and inhibits its tumor suppressor activity by phosphorylating PML protein at Ser403 and Thr409 (Yang et al., 2010). ERK5-mediated phosphorylation impairs PML-dependent activation of p21, through disrupting PML-MDM2 interaction, and downregulating expression of the p53 tumor suppressor (Yang et al., 2013)\n",
      "Mechanisms involved in ERK5 nuclear translocation\n",
      "ERK5 acts as a transcriptional co-activator, regulating MEF2C, AP-1, and c-Fos transcriptional activities in the nucleus. Therefore, translocation of ERK5 to nucleus is essential to regulate ERK5-mediated gene transcription. ERK5 is a big protein (110 kDa) so it cannot enter the nucleus by passive diffusion through the nuclear pores, as described for small proteins\n",
      "Recently, we have shown that inactive ERK5 binds the cytoplasmatic chaperone Hsp90 and the co-chaperone cell division-cycle 37 (Cdc37), which helps Hsp90 in the stabilization of ERK5 (Erazo et al., 2013). Cdc37 is the co-chaperone that specifically promotes association of Hsp90 with many protein kinases (Smith and Workman, 2009). This trimeric complex, ERK5-Hsp90-Cdc37, not only stabilizes inactive ERK5, but also keeps ERK5 in a suitable conformation for MEK5 recognition and activation (Erazo et al., 2013)\n",
      "In basal conditions, ERK5 binds the cytoplasmatic chaperone Hsp90, which serves as a cytosolic anchor for ERK5 (Erazo et al., 2013). This inactive ERK5 adopts a closed conformation where the C-terminal tail interacts with the kinase domain and the NLS motif is hidden and not available for the nuclear transport (reviewed in Kondoh et al., 2006). Nuclear shuttling of ERK5 requires both a conformational change to allow exposure of the NLS motif and the release of Hsp90. This mechanism is analogous to the one described for the progesterone and androgen receptors, which also requires Hsp90 dissociation for their nuclear translocation (Picard, 2006)\n",
      "So far, two different mechanisms have been proposed for the ERK5 shuttling to the nucleus: one of them requires C-terminal phosphorylation, while the other does not. Once in the nucleus, ERK5 enhances gene transcription by either phosphorylating transcription factors, or by interacting with these factors through the transactivation TAD domain located at the C-terminal. Strikingly, ERK5 does not require kinase activity to interact with and activate transcription factors and therefore, forms of nuclear ERK5 devoid of kinase activity are able to activate transcription (Diaz-Rodriguez and Pandiella, 2010; Inesta-Vaquera et al., 2010; Erazo et al., 2013). Kinase-independent nuclear functions have been also proposed for other MAP kinases that lack a TAD domain. For instance, ERK2 promotes cell cycle entry by disrupting retinoblastoma-lamin A complexes in a kinase-independent fashion (Rodriguez et al., 2010), and also binds DNA acting as a transcriptional repressor for interferon gamma-induced genes (Hu et al., 2009). It would be interesting to study if ERK5 can also bind DNA\n",
      "Nuclear translocation dependent of ERK5 C-Terminal phosphorylation\n",
      "In response to EGF stimulation or different stresses MEK5 becomes activated, which in turn activates ERK5 by dual phosphorylation of the TEY motif. Then, active ERK5 phosphorylates its C-terminal tail resulting in a sequence of events that include: (1) dissociation of the cytosolic anchor Hsp90 from ERK5-Cdc37 complex; (2) adoption of a conformation in which the NLS motif is exposed; and (3) nuclear translocation (Figure 1)\n",
      "Figure 1 Molecular mechanisms controlling nucleocytoplasmatic transport of ERK5. Different mechanisms have been proposed for ERK5 shuttling to the nucleus, depending or not of C-terminal phosphorylation. Once in the nucleus, ERK5 enhances gene transcription by either phosphorylating transcription factors, or by interacting with these factors through the transactivation TAD domain located at the C-terminal. ERK5 does not require kinase activity to interact with and activate transcription factors and therefore, forms of nuclear ERK5 devoid of kinase activity are able to activate transcription. Inactive ERK5 binds the cytoplasmatic chaperone Hsp90 and co-chaperone Cdc37, which helps Hsp90 in the stabilization of ERK5 (Erazo et al., 2013). In basal conditions, Hsp90 serves as a cytosolic anchor for ERK5, and inactive ERK5 adopts a closed conformation where the NLS motif is hidden and not available for the nuclear transport. Nuclear shuttling of ERK5 requires both a conformational change to allow exposure of the NLS motif and the release of Hsp90 (Erazo et al., 2013). In response to growth factors stimulation or different stresses, activated MEK5 phosphorylates and activates ERK5. Then, active ERK5 phosphorylates its C-terminal tail resulting in dissociation of the cytosolic anchor Hsp90 from ERK5-Cdc37 complex, adoption of an open conformation in which the NLS motif is exposed, and nuclear translocation. ERK5 C-terminal tail can also be phosphorylated by other kinases, such as Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) during mitosis. This phosphorylation is not MEK5-dependent but induce the release of Hsp90 and nuclear translocation of a kinase-inactive form of ERK5 which retains its transcriptional activity (Diaz-Rodriguez and Pandiella, 2010; Inesta-Vaquera et al., 2010). Finally, overexpression of Cdc37 (reported to happen in some cancers) induces the release of Hsp90 and nuclear shuttling of a kinase-inactive but transcriptionally active form of ERK5 (Erazo et al., 2013)\n",
      "ERK5 autophosphorylates several Thr/Ser residues within its C-terminal region. Mody et al., using purified recombinant active ERK5 and mass-spectrometry analysis, first identified five autophosphorylation sites at the C-terminal region: Ser421, Ser433, Ser496, Ser731, and Thr733 (Mody et al., 2003). Another laboratory also reported autophosphorylation in residues Ser760, Ser764, and Ser766, in addition to Thr733 (Morimoto et al., 2007). Inhibition of ERK5 autophosphorylation prevents the release of Hsp90 and nuclear entry (Erazo et al., 2013), reflecting that C-terminal tail autophosphorylation plays a critical role in ERK5 nuclear shuttling in response to MEK5 stimulation. Consequently, mutant forms of ERK5 in which the autophosphorylated residues at the C-terminal were mutated to alanine show cytoplasmatic localization and constitutive association to Hsp90 (Erazo et al., 2013), whereas the mutant in which these residues were mutated to glutamic acid does not bind Hsp90 (Erazo et al., 2013) and shows nuclear localization (Morimoto et al., 2007; Diaz-Rodriguez and Pandiella, 2010). Therefore, autophosphorylation of the C-terminal tail induces the release of Hsp90 from the ERK5-Cdc37 complex, a step essential previous nuclear translocation\n",
      "ERK5 C-terminal tail can also be phosphorylated by other kinases. During mitosis, ERK5 is phosphorylated at residues Ser567, Ser720, Ser731, Thr733, Ser753, and Ser830 (Diaz-Rodriguez and Pandiella, 2010; Inesta-Vaquera et al., 2010). These phosphorylations are not MEK5-dependent but induce the nuclear translocation of a kinase-inactive form of ERK5 which retains its transcriptional activity. These events might represent a second pathway controlling ERK5 C-terminal phosphorylation, which is activated in mitotic cells and involves kinase activities distinct from MEK5. Cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (CDK1) might well phosphorylate these sites, since either roscovitine or the RO3306 inhibitor reverse mitotic phosphorylation of ERK5 (Diaz-Rodriguez and Pandiella, 2010; Inesta-Vaquera et al., 2010)\n",
      "All in all, C-terminal phosphorylation integrates different signals that converge in ERK5 nuclear shuttling and activation of transcription. ERK5 C-term autophosphorylation would represent a MEK5-dependent mechanism that integrate signals such as growth factors (EGF) and oxidative and osmotic stresses that activate MEK5-ERK5 pathway. On the other hand, C-terminal phosphorylation by other kinases (such as CDK1 during mitosis) represents a mechanism of nuclear translocation that does not require ERK5 kinase activity, but results in ERK5-mediated activation of transcription\n",
      "Nuclear translocation independent of ERK5 C-Terminal phosphorylation\n",
      "We have described a new mechanism for ERK5 nuclear translocation which is independent of C-terminal phosphorylation. Expression of high levels of Cdc37 induces the release of Hsp90 and the nuclear shuttling of a kinase-inactive form of ERK5 that retains its transcriptional activity (Erazo et al., 2013). This mechanism does not involve ERK5 activation or C-terminal phosphorylation by other kinases; overexpression of Cdc37 induced nuclear translocation and ERK5-mediated gene transcription in the presence of the specific inhibitor XMD8-92 or in MEK5 KO cells (Erazo et al., 2013)\n",
      "The relevance of this new mechanism relays on the fact that Cdc37 acts as an oncogene, stabilizing other oncogenes that are mutated or overexpressed in cancer cells such as Akt, Her-2, or BRAF (Smith and Workman, 2009). Overexpression of Cdc37 has been observed in prostate adenocarcinoma, where it collaborates with c-Myc and cyclin D1 in the transformation of this tumor (Stepanova et al., 2000; Gray et al., 2007). Remarkably, in vitro evidences suggest that Cdc37 collaborates with ERK5 to promote proliferation of PC3 prostatic adenocarcinoma cells (Erazo et al., 2013). Cdc37 is also overexpressed in acute myelocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma (Casas et al., 2003; Katayama et al., 2004). It would be interesting to explore in these cancer cells if ERK5 shows constitutive nuclear localization and also collaborates with Cdc37 to promote cell proliferation. If so, and given the fact that Cdc37 induces nuclear shuttling of a kinase-inactive form of ERK5, we predict that these cancers will not respond to ERK5 inhibitors\n",
      "Perspectives\n",
      "During the last years, efforts of many laboratories have led to delineate the importance of ERK5 in controlling cell proliferation in normal and cancer cells, by mechanisms that are both dependent and independent of its kinase activity: nuclear ERK5 activates transcription factors by either direct phosphorylation or acting as co-activator thanks to a unique transcriptional activation domain located at its C-terminal tail. Consequently, ERK5 has been proposed as an interesting target to tackle different cancers, and either inhibitors of ERK5 activity or silencing the protein have shown antiproliferative activity in cancer cells and to block tumor growth in animal models. However, and as we have seen above, ERK5 kinase inhibitors such as XMD8-92 might not be useful in cancers showing kinase-inactive nuclear ERK5. On the other hand, the anticancer activity of ERK5 inhibitors should be carefully interpreted. It has been recently reported that several classes of kinase inhibitors can strongly inhibit the bromodomain-containing protein-4 Brd4, a general transcription co-activator (Ciceri et al., 2014). This is the case for XMD8-92, which inhibits Brd4 and ERK5 with similar potency (Lin et al., 2016), and therefore some of the antitumor effects of this compound could be mediated by the Brd4-inhibiting activity. A new generation of specific ERK5 inhibitors are required to clarify the exact role of ERK5 in cancer cell growth\n",
      "There are still many open questions that remain to be addressed in order to describe the precise mechanism involved in ERK5 nuclear shuttling. For instance, is CDK1 the only kinase that phosphorylates ERK5 C-terminal tail? Does Cdc37 overexpression mimic a physiological mechanism that allows nuclear shuttling of inactive ERK5? Are other post-translational modifications, such as SUMOylation, required for ERK5 nuclear translocation? What is the role of ERK5 phosphatases in this process? The very near future seems an exciting time to deal with these questions, and hopefully will provide clues to design new compounds with antiproliferative activity\n",

HNCs are important contributors to cancer incidence and mortality, leading to approximately 225,100 new patients and 77,500 deaths in China every year. Determination of the mechanisms of HNC carcinogenesis and progression is an urgent priority in HNC treatment. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are noncoding RNAs longer than 200 bps. lncRNAs have been reported to participate in a broad scope of biological processes, and lncRNA dysregulation leads to diverse human diseases, including cancer. In this review, we focus on lncRNAs that are dysregulated in HNCs, summarize the latest findings regarding the function and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in HNC carcinogenesis and progression, and discuss the clinical application of lncRNAs in HNC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy\n",

      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Head and neck cancer (HNC) is a class of malignant tumors that arise in the tissues of the upper neck, such as the tongue, gingiva, nasopharynx, larynx, and thyroid [1–3]. Head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) constitutes the majority (nearly 90%) of HNCs, with smoking and alcohol consumption as the major risk factors. In recent years, accumulating evidence suggests that human papillomavirus infection is closely related to the occurrence of HNC [4]. HNC constitutes an important component of cancer incidence and mortality, leading to approximately 225,100 new patients and 77,500 deaths in China every year [5]. Although advanced therapeutics have been applied to treat HNC, the 5-five-year survival rate has not increased significantly and the mortality rate has not decreased significantly in recent decades [6]. HNC is usually discovered and diagnosed in the advanced stages, a factor that significantly contributes to the high mortality rates; however, current treatments may be ineffective in suppressing HNC progression and have many side effects. Early diagnosis and effective therapy play an important role in HNC treatment [7–9]. Elucidation of the mechanisms of HNC carcinogenesis and progression may enable the discovery of early diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets\n",
      "Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a focus of current research, particularly cancer research. lncRNAs are noncoding polyadenylated RNAs longer than 200 bps. The transcription of lncRNAs is typically executed by RNA polymerase II, and their expression is generally tissue-specific [10]. Previously, lncRNAs have been considered byproducts of a leaky transcriptional system, but recent findings suggest a different role. As shown in numerous reports, lncRNAs are indispensable and are involved in a spectrum of biological processes, including embryogenesis, stem-cell biology and cellular differentiation. Anomalous lncRNAs are suggested to be closely associated with multiple human diseases, including cancer [10–15]. For HNC, a distinct lncRNA expression profile between HNC tumors and normal human tissues has been identified and it evolves as the HNC progresses [16]. Research into the cellular functions of lncRNAs has verified that lncRNAs play significant roles in HNC carcinogenesis and that lncRNA-mediated biology is related to HNC progression. lncRNAs may serve as oncogenes or tumor suppressors by participating in the modulation of HNC cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and invasion [16, 17]. Some cancer-associated lncRNAs have well-characterized roles in HNC development, suggesting that lncRNAs can be used as new biomarkers for HNC diagnosis and prognosis and as therapeutic targets for HNC intervention [17]\n",
      "In this review, we will focus on the lncRNAs that are dysregulated in HNC, including oral cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharynx cancer and thyroid cancer. Additionally, we will summarize the latest findings regarding the biological function and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in HNC carcinogenesis and progression and explore the clinical application of lncRNAs as targets for HNC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy\n",
      "LNCRNAS IN HNC\n",
      "Many lncRNAs are dysregulated in HNC and play important roles in HNC biology. Some lncRNAs that are up-regulated in HNC may act as oncogenes to promote cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion and to inhibit apoptosis. Some lncRNAs possess tumor-inhibiting functions and are down-regulated in HNC, accelerating oncogenesis and tumor development [16–18]. lncRNAs regulate gene transcription by associating with enzymes or protein complexes, thus participating in chromosome remodeling and epigenetic regulation. lncRNAs also regulate the transcription and translation of mRNAs by repressing miRNAs or altering mRNA modifications [10, 19, 20]. The biological functions and molecular mechanisms of specific lncRNAs in HNC are reviewed below (Table 1)\n",

      "HOTAIR\n",
      "HOTAIR (HOX antisense intergenic RNA) is a 2158-nucleotide mRNA-like lncRNA located at chromosome 12q13.13 that is transcribed from the antisense strand of the HOXC gene cluster by RNA polymerase II [21]. HOTAIR is not well conserved across species, and human HOTAIR contains 6 exons [22]. HOTAIR is up-regulated in many types of cancer and is related to oncogenesis, metastasis and poor prognosis in HNC, cervical cancer, and colon cancer [23–25]. HOTAIR recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) through its 5′-end binding domain and lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1) through its 3′-end binding domain to targets to repress gene expression. The histone methylase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is one component of PRC2, and the histone demethylase LSD1 is a flavin-dependent monoamine oxidase. HOTAIR interacts with EZH2 or LSD1, leading to gene silencing via H3K27-methylation or H3K4-demethylation, respectively [26, 27]\n",
      "Recently, HOTAIR was shown to be dysregulated in HNC, including laryngeal squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and oral squamous-cell carcinoma (OSCC) [28–32]. HOTAIR expression in LSCC tissues is 16-fold higher than in normal tissues, and increase in HOTAIR expression is statistically correlated with advanced tumor grade, lymph node metastasis (LNM), poor differentiation and advanced clinical stages. HOTAIR knockdown reduces cell invasion and increases cell apoptosis in vitro and inhibits LSCC xenograft growth in vivo. As revealed by a mechanistic study, HOTAIR serves as an oncogene by repressing phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) expression to up-regulate DNA methylation. HOTAIR accumulation in cancer cells induces the hypermethylation of CpG islands in the PTEN gene, reducing the expression of PTEN at the mRNA and protein levels [28]. Because PTEN acts as a tumor repressor by inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway [33], the increased expression of HOTAIR in LSCC promotes cancer progression by activating the PI3K pathway [28]. HOTAIR expression is significantly increased in HNC and is correlated with cancer progression [29–32]. Additionally, in OSCC tumors, HOTAIR recruits EZH2 to the promoter region of E-cadherin and silences the expression of E-cadherin by increasing the levels of the H3K27me3 modification [30, 31]. HOTAIR is abundantly expressed in NPC tumor tissues and promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth. HOTAIR stimulates NPC angiogenesis by increasing the expression levels of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) [32]. GRP78, a member of the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, induces tumor angiogenesis and regulates the tumor microenvironment during tumor growth and metastasis [34, 35]. Furthermore, the expression of GRP78 in NPC increases the transcription of the angiogenic factors VEGF-A and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) [32]. Thus, increased HOTAIR expression promotes cancer progression, and HOTAIR functions as an oncogene in HNC\n",
      "H19\n",
      "The discovery of H19 has attracted the attention of many scientists and prompted them to study lncRNAs. H19 contains 5 exons and 4 introns and encodes a 2.3-kb noncoding RNA [11]. Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), a growth factor, stimulates tumor growth via autocrine or endocrine pathways [36]. Genomic imprinting is a type of hereditary epigenetic regulation that ensures the expression of parent-specific genes. Thus, only one of the parental imprinted alleles can be transcribed and translated [37]. H19 and IGF2 are a pair of imprinted genes on chromosome 11p15.5 that participate in embryonic development and growth regulation [11]. H19 gene is maternally expressed, and IGF2 is transcribed from the paternal allele. High H19 expression has been observed during embryogenesis, but the transcripts are not expressed in most tissues after birth, with the exception of the heart and skeletal muscle [38]. However, loss of imprinting (LOI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) have been observed at the IGF2-H19 locus in many cancers [39–45]. LOI at H19 leads to the transcription of H19 from the maternal and paternal alleles, and LOH at H19 inhibits the expression of H19. Hypomethylation in the H19 promoter region may be the main cause of H19 LOI. Moreover, c-Myc also activates H19 transcription in cancer by binding to the regulatory region in its gene. Mutation leads to H19 LOH, and the expression of H19 in cancer is down-regulated by p53 [40, 41]. Both LOI and LOH of H19 are associated with cancer carcinogenesis and progression. Re-expression of H19 in NPC suggests that H19 might be an oncogene [39], and the down-regulation of H19 in some HNSCC samples implies that H19 might be a tumor suppressor [42]. Although H19 has been enthusiastically studied for several years, the details of the mechanisms by which H19 functions as a tumor inhibitor or oncogene in cancer and its precise biological functions require further clarification\n",
      "Genomic imprinting plays important roles in organism development. LOI at the IGF2-H19 locus and aberrant H19 expression have been observed in HNC and may be related to HNC oncogenesis and progression [39, 42]. Among 64 HNSCC cases, 12 of 32 cases (37.5%) were showed a loss of imprinting at the H19 gene and 11 of 27 cases (40.7%) showed a for loss of imprinting at the IGF2 gene [44]. Among 27 samples from patients with Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA), 8 of 22 samples (36.4%) exhibited H19 over-expression and 7 of 19 samples (36.8%) exhibited IGF2 over-expression [43]. In another cohort of 35 HNSCC patients, 11 exhibited H19 re-expression. Among patients showing H19 expression, 6 had T2-grade tumors and 5 eventually presented recurrence and/or metastasis. In contrast, in patients without H19 expression, including 5 with T2-grade tumors, only 1 exhibited regional recurrence [45]. Up-regulation of H19 has been confirmed in undifferentiated NPC biopsies and LSCC tumor tissues and is related to low LSCC survival rates and cancer progression [39]. Hypomethylation of CpG dinucleotides in the H19 promoter region may be the main epigenetic event that induces H19 transcription [39]. The level of DNA methylation in the H19 promoter region regulates H19 expression, and the level of cellular DNA methylation is also regulated by H19. miR-148a-3p is a target of inhibition by H19, and miR-148a-3p reduces the levels of the DNA methyltransferase enzyme 1 (DNMT1) mRNA and protein, affecting cellular DNA methylation. Thus, H19 regulates the level of cellular DNA methylation through the H19/miR-148a-3p/DNMT1 cascade, and H19 may promote HNC cell migration, invasion and proliferation by increasing DNA methylation [46]\n",
      "MEG3\n",
      "Maternally Expressed Gene 3 (MEG3), a tumor suppressor, is involved in the development and progression of many cancers [47–49]. MEG3 is an imprinted gene located at chromosome 14q32 that encodes a 1.6-kb noncoding RNA from the maternal allele [50]. It is broadly distributed in many normal human tissues; however, MEG3 is not expressed in a series of human tumors and tumor cell lines, such as tongue squamous-cell carcinoma (TSCC), brain cancer, and hepatocellular cancer [47, 48, 51]. One of the main mechanisms of MEG3 silencing is hypermethylation of the MEG3 promoter region [52]. The loss of MEG3 expression promotes tumor progression through specific molecular mechanisms, and re-expression of MEG3 in tumor cells inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis [51]. MEG3 inhibits tumorigenesis by increasing the expression of P53 and Growth Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15). p53 is a tumor suppressor protein, and GDF15 reduces tumor cell proliferation and tumor formation. MEG3 increases p53 levels by reducing its ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation [53]. MEG3 can down-regulate the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, which mediates p53 ubiquitination and increase its stability and expression levels in the cell. GDF15 is also a target of MEG3, which can increase GDF15 expression in a p53-dependent manner [53]\n",
      "Low MEG3 expression is associated with TSCC progression. MEG3 levels are significantly reduced in TSCC tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. Low MEG3 levels are associated with high TSCC mortality and poor overall survival. Over-expression of MEG3 in SCC-15 and CAL27 cell lines inhibits cell proliferation, arrests the cell cycle and induces apoptosis [51]. The reduction of the miR-26a levels in TSCC down-regulates MEG3 by increasing the DNA methylation levels. DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) is a key enzyme in the DNA methylation process. DNMT3B mRNA contains a miR-26a target site in its 3′untranslated region (3′UTR), and miR-26a reduces the translation of DNMT3B by binding to its mRNA. Down-regulated of miR-26a in TSCC increases the level of DNMT3B, promoting DNA methylation and inhibiting MEG3 transcription [51, 54]\n",
      "MALAT1\n",
      "Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) was first identified in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Up-regulation of MALAT1 in NSCLC is associated with cancer metastasis and is a biological marker used to predict disease outcomes in patients with early-stage NSCLC [55]. A MALAT1 transcript longer than 8,000 bps is abundantly expressed in the nucleus and is also known as nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 2 (NEAT2) [56]. MALAT1 was reported to be specifically up-regulated in many cancers, such as ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer, in several studies [57–59]. High MALAT1 expression levels in cancer promote cell proliferation, migration and invasion. MALAT1 accelerates cancer progression by regulating the expression of some ‘metastatic signature’ genes [60]. MALAT1 regulates gene expression at the transcriptional level by affecting the alternative splicing process and modulating the location and phosphorylation states of serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors [61]\n",
      "Higher MALAT1 expression levels have been observed in LSCC tumor tissues and are significantly associated with a poor histological grade or an advanced clinical stage [30]. MALAT1 is also highly expressed in NPC tissues and it is closely related to LNM and advanced NPC stages [62]. Interference with MALAT1 expression in cancer inhibits tumor growth and metastasis and increases tumor cell apoptosis and sensitivity to radiotherapy [62, 63]. The Slug protein plays a considerable role in elevating cancer stem-cell (CSC) activity and tumor radioresistance. MALAT1 increases the levels of the slug mRNA and protein by acting as a competing endogenous RNA. The binding of MALAT1 to miR-1 reduces the levels of miR-1 and the slug mRNA. MALAT1 eliminates miR1-induced slug gene silencing [64]\n",
      "Other lncRNAs in HNC\n",
      "lncRNA urothelial cancer-associated 1 (UCA1) is involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. UCA1 is expressed at a dramatically higher level in TSCC tumor tissues than in neighboring non-tumor tissues, and patients with LNM express much higher levels of UCA1. High UCA1 expression in TSCC increases cell migration [65]. The specific mechanisms by which UCA1 contributes to TSCC progression remain to be elucidated\n",
      "Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) is a crucial cancer-related gene. FOXC1 promotes cancer progression by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell proliferation and migration [66]. FOXC1 regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and VEGF-A. MMPs regulate cancer cell migration and VEGF-A promotes tumor angiogenesis. FOXC1 upstream transcript (FOXCUT) is a lncRNA that is substantially over-expressed in OSCC. Over-expression of FOXCUT in OSCC promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration by regulating FOXC1 expression. The levels of the FOXC1 mRNA are positively associated with the levels of the FOXCUT transcript, and FOXCUT silencing substantially reduces FOXC1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels [67]\n",
      "The lncRNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript1 (NEAT1) is an oncogene in many malignancies, including LSCC [68–71]. High NEAT1 expression is closely related to LSCC tumorigenesis, and patients with neck nodal metastasis exhibit high NEAT1 expression. NEAT1 knockdown in LSCC suppresses tumor growth, increases cell apoptosis and arrests the cell cycle. NEAT1 promotes LSCC tumorigenesis by regulating the miR-107/cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) pathway [71]. The CDK6 protein belongs to the CDK family, regulating the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle [72]. miR-107 represses CDK6 expression by targeting its 3′UTR. NEAT1 increases CDK6 expression by down-regulating miR-107 expression [71]\n",
      "The lncRNA actin filament-associated protein 1 antisense RNA1 (AFAP1-AS1) is up-regulated in NPC and is related to NPC progression and poor patient survival. AFAP1-AS1 knockdown represses NPC cell invasion and migration in vitro and inhibits NPC lung metastasis in nude mice. AFAP1-AS1 regulates AFAP1 and some cytoskeleton-regulated proteins, including proteins in the small GTPase-signaling Rho/Rac pathway [73]. AFAP1 regulates actin filament integrity and stimulates lamellipodia formation. Small GTPases modulate actin cytoskeleton formation, which is associated with cell shape and migration [74]. AFAP1-AS1 promotes NPC cell metastasis by affecting the integrity of actin filaments [73]\n",
      "The lncRNA hepatocyte nuclear factor 1A-antisense RNA (HNF1A-AS) may modulate tumorigenesis in NPC. HNF1A-AS expression is much higher in NPC tumor tissues than in matched normal tissues. Over-expression of HNF1A-AS in NPC increases tumor cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle progression. HNF1A-AS may stimulate NPC tumor growth and metastasis by accelerating the EMT. In NPC, HNF1A-AS increases the levels of the mesenchymal proteins N-cadherin and vimentin and reduces the level of epithelial protein E-cadherin [75]\n",
      "Radioresistance and chemoresistance are key drivers of cancer mortality, and the lncRNA-ROR is related to NPC chemoresistance. lncRNA-ROR expression is significantly increased in NPC tissues compared with in normal tissues. lncRNA-ROR expression in NPC cells is positively correlated with cell proliferation, metastasis and suppression of apoptosis. High lncRNA-ROR expression increase the ability of NPC cells to resist chemotherapy. lncRNA-ROR facilitates NPC chemoresistance and progression, possibly by inhibiting the p53 signaling pathway. lncRNA-ROR may constitute a medical target by which to decrease NPC chemoresistance [76]\n",
      "lncRNA-LET (low expression in tumor) is a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in NPC tumor tissue and NPC cell lines compared with paired non-cancer tissues and nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. LET down-regulation is significantly associated with an advanced NPC clinical stage, a greater tumor volume, an increased lymph node tumor burden, and a lower overall survival rate. Forced LET expression in CNE2 cells inhibits cell proliferation and increases cell apoptosis. Injection of LET-over-expressing cells into nude mice reduces tumor growth, and low lncRNA-LET levels are critically involved in NPC tumor cell proliferation. Further research suggests that low levels of LET expression are induced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 histone methylation in the LET promoter region [77]\n",
      "A study of gene mutations in 402 Chinese NPC samples revealed that the growth arrest-specific 8-antisense RNA 1 (GAS8-AS1) is the second most commonly mutated gene and the lncRNA GAS8-AS1 may serve as a tumor inhibitor. The levels of the lncRNA GAS8-AS1 are significantly decreased in PTC. Increased GAS8-AS1 expression substantially inhibits PTC cell viability. Furthermore, GAS8-AS1 mutations in PTC are associated with an advanced clinical stage, and the wild-type lncRNA GAS8-AS1 is a stronger suppressor of tumor growth than mutated lncRNA GAS8-AS1 [78]\n",
      "Recently, a novel lncRNA LOC401317 was shown to be up-regulated in human NPC cell lines over-expressing TP53, and the transcription of the lncRNA LOC401317 is directly regulated by p53. As revealed in functional studies, LOC401317 is a tumor suppressor and LOC401317 transfection in NPC cells represses tumor cell proliferation, arrests the cell cycle and increases cell apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations revealed that LOC401317 inhibits the cell cycle in cancer cells by increasing the level of p21 and reducing the levels of cyclins D1 and E1. LOC401317 expedites apoptosis by inducing the activation of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 [79]\n",
      "The levels of the lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) are significantly increased in thyroid cancer (TC) tissues compared to neighboring normal tissues. PVT1 silencing in TC cell lines obviously inhibits cell proliferation and arrests the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. PVT1 increases the mRNA and protein levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) and the cell cycle-associated protein cyclin D1 [80]. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and TSHR are associated with cell proliferation [81]. Furthermore, the lncRNA PVT1 recruits EZH2 to target genes, repressing the expression of some tumor suppressor genes. Recruitment of EZH2 and regulation of the TSHR levels may be the two mechanisms by which the lncRNA PVT1 facilitates TC oncogenesis [80]\n",
      "A novel lncRNA, non-protein coding RNA, associated with MAP kinase pathway and growth arrest (NAMA), is, as its name suggests, related to the MAP kinase pathway and cell-growth arrest. NAMA levels are reduced in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). NAMA over-expression in PTC cells promotes cell apoptosis and arrests the cell cycle. NAMA expression is induced by BRAF knockdown, suppression of the MAP kinase pathway, growth arrest and DNA damage. NAMA induction may be a molecular event or secondary signal that induces growth arrest and apoptosis [82]. However, further research is required to explore the functions and potential targets of NAMA\n",
      "Papillary thyroid cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (PTCSC2) and 3 (PTCSC3) are two novel thyroid-specific lncRNAs that may serve as tumor suppressors. The expression levels of PTCSC2 and PTCSC3 are strongly down-regulated in PTC tumor tissues and in TC tissues, respectively, compared with neighboring normal tissues. Over-expression of PTCSC2 in PTC cells influences the expression of some cancer-related and cell-cycle-related genes. Re-expression of PTCSC3 in TC cells represses tumor growth and influences the transcription of some genes associated with DNA replication, recombination, repair, cellular movement, tumor morphology, and cell death. Down-regulation of PTCSC2 or PTCSC3 is related to PTC or TC and increases the risk of developing PTC or TC. PTCSC2 and PTCSC3 may be involved in the genetic predisposition to PTC and TC. The polymorphisms rs965513 and rs944289 are related to PTC and TC risk via PTCSC2 and PTCSC3, respectively. The risk allele (A) of rs965513 is significantly associated with down-regulation of PTCSC2 in normal thyroid tissues. The risk allele (T) of rs944289 is strongly related to the down-regulation of PTCSC3 in TC tumor tissues [83, 84]\n",
      "The connection between the level of the lncRNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) and patients’ clinicopathological characteristics has been explored. High HOTTIP expression has been confirmed in TSCC and is positively correlated with high T classification, advanced clinical stages and distant metastasis [85]. The lncRNA ENST00000438550 was identified in an analysis of the differences in the lncRNA expression profiles between metastatic and primary NPC tumors. ENST00000438550 is strongly associated with the progression of NPC patients, and ENST00000438550 might be a prognostic biomarker and a potential treatment target in NPC [86]. An investigation of 100 PTC samples shows that focally amplified lncRNA on chromosome 1 (FAL1) is expressed at higher levels in PTC tissues than in surrounding healthy tissues. FAL1 over-expression greatly increases the risk of multifocality, and FAL1 might be associated with PTC malignancy [87]. The lncRNA AB209630 may be a tumor suppressor in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC). Down-regulation of AB209630 promotes HSCC tumor growth, metastasis and invasion. HSCC patients with high AB209630 levels have a better prognosis than patients with low AB209630 levels. AB209630 may be a valuable target in HSCC therapy [88]. lncRNAs play an important role in promoting HNC tumorigenesis and development. The known mechanisms by which some lncRNAs function in HNC are shown in Figure 1, and the as yet unknown mechanisms require further research\n",

      "CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF LNCRNAS IN HNC\n",
      "lncRNAs are broadly involved in HNC oncogenesis and progression. The key roles of lncRNAs in HNC imply that lncRNAs may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for HNC diagnosis, prognosis and treatment\n",
      "Tumor diagnosis\n",
      "The early diagnosis of HNC improves overall survival. lncRNAs play a vital role in the physiological and pathological progression of HNC, and the presence of lncRNAs in peripheral blood and body fluids suggests that they may be used as diagnostic biomarkers [89, 90]\n",
      "Diagnostic biomarkers in OSCC\n",
      "Some well-documented lncRNAs, such as MALAT-1 and HOTAIR, are present in the saliva of OSCC patients. Patients with LNM exhibit higher HOTAIR expression in their saliva than patients with non-metastatic cancer. The presence of some lncRNAs in patients’ saliva may be associated with OSCC development, and measuring the lncRNA levels in saliva may provide a convenient method to rapidly and non-invasively diagnose OSCC [90]. HOTAIR expression in OSCC tissues is also correlated with a larger tumor size and advanced clinical stages, suggesting that HOTAIR may be used as a biomarker for diagnosing OSCC [29]\n",
      "Diagnostic biomarkers in LSCC\n",
      "The combination of the serum levels of the HOTAIR and miR-21 exosomes is valuable for diagnosing LSCC. The serum levels of HOTAIR and miR-21 exosomes were higher in 52 LSCC patients than in 49 patients with vocal cord polyps, and high expression levels of miR-21 and HOTAIR in LSCC patients are significantly associated with advanced clinical stages and LNM. Moreover, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combination of HOTAIR and miR-21 is 87.6%, which is greater than the value observed for serum exosomes of miR-21 (80.1%) or HOTAIR (72.7%). The combination of HOTAIR and miR-21 might be a promising molecular marker to screen for LSCC [91]\n",
      "Diagnostic biomarkers in NPC\n",
      "LINC00312 is distinctly down-regulated in NPC, and positive LINC00312 expression is negatively correlated to the clinical classification and tumor size. LINC00312 expression is used to distinguish healthy persons from NPC patients. Down-regulation of LINC00312 may contribute to NPC oncogenesis and may be used to diagnose early-stage NPC. The dysregulation of lncRNAs in HNC may be a promising indicator for use in providing an exact and early cancer diagnosis [92]\n",
      "Tumor prognosis\n",
      "The dysregulation of many lncRNAs is significantly related to HNC pathogenesis and prognosis. These molecules may be used as potential prognostic predictors, and their expression levels may predict patients’ disease outcomes [17]\n",
      "Prognostic biomarkers in OSCC\n",
      "HOTTIP, MEG3, and HOTAIR could be used as independent prognostic parameters in TSCC. High HOTTIP expression has been observed in TSCC tissues, and patients with T3-4-grade tumors, distant metastasis or patients in clinical stages III-IV exhibit higher HOTTIP expression than patients with T1-2-grade tumors and no distant metastasis or patients in clinical stages I-II. HOTTIP over-expression is strongly associated with poor overall survival (OS) [85]. MEG3 expression is much lower in TSCC tumor tissues than in nearby nonmalignant tissues, and patients with low MEG3 expression always have short survival times [51]. HOTAIR expression is higher in OSCC tumor tissue than in paired normal tissue, and high HOTAIR expression always indicates a relatively poor OS or disease-free survival (DFS) [29]\n",
      "Prognostic biomarkers in NPC\n",
      "The lncRNAs HOTAIR, AFAP1-AS1 and ENST00000438550 could be used as prognostic biomarkers to predict disease outcomes in NPC patients [23, 73, 86]. Excessive AFAP1-AS1 levels have been detected in NPC samples compared with normal nasopharyngeal epithelium samples. AFAP1-AS1 up-regulation is related to distant tumor metastasis and poor OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) [73]. HOTAIR expression is also higher in paraffin-embedded NPC biopsies than in non-tumor tissue samples, and high HOTAIR levels are associated with advanced clinical stages and a poor prognosis [23]. The ENST00000438550 expression level is positively correlated with NPC progression, and high levels of ENST00000438550 are an indicator of NPC progression. Some down-regulated lncRNAs are also used as molecule tools to predict NPC outcomes [86]. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test have been used to analyze the predictive potential of lncRNAs. Down-regulation of LET in NPC is related to poor RFS and OS, and low LET expression may predict a poor prognosis of NPC patients [77]. Positive LINC00312 expression in NPC patients without LNM is significantly correlated with good DFS and OS; however, high LINC00312 expression in patients with LNM is correlated with poor DFS and OS. LINC00312 may be a powerful independent indicator of NPC patient survival [92]\n",
      "Prognostic biomarkers in LSCC\n",
      "The lncRNA HOTAIR might be a diagnostic marker for LSCC and an independent prognostic factor for LSCC [28]. HOTAIR levels are higher in LSCC tumor tissues than in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and are significantly associated with shorter patient survival. HOTAIR has a major effect on LSCC progression and is an independent prognostic indicator [28]. Low expression levels of AC026166.2-001 and RP11-169D4.1-001 are statistically linked to OS in LSCC patients and are independent indicators of a poor prognosis [93]. Thus, lncRNAs may be used as prognostic factors to forecast cancer outcomes\n",
      "Tumor treatment\n",
      "The considerable importance of abnormal lncRNAs expression in HNC development and progression suggests that lncRNAs are potential therapeutic targets. Some tumorigenic lncRNAs are up-regulated in HNC and promote cancer growth. However, their cancer-promoting effects could be weakened by interference by siRNAs [28–31]. Reduction of the HOTAIR or MALAT1 levels in LSCC inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis [28, 63]. In addition, tumor-suppressing lncRNAs are expressed at low levels in cancer tissues, and transfection of an lncRNA expression vector in cancer cells to increase their expression inhibits tumor growth [50, 51]. MEG3 expression is substantially reduced in OSCC tumor cell lines. Increased MEG3 levels in OSCC cells suppress cell proliferation, disrupt the cell cycle and stimulate apoptosis [51]. Thus, restoration of the expression of these lncRNAs in HNC may be a feasible therapeutic approach\n",
      "Some medical treatments for cancer target dysregulated lncRNAs and reduce the levels of aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in tumor tissues [93, 94]. The lncRNAs CDKN2B-AS1, HOTAIR and MALAT1 are up-regulated in LSCC. The levels of CDKN2B-AS1, HOTAIR and MALAT1 in LSCC cells are substantially reduced by cisplatin and paclitaxel in a concentration- and time-dependent manner [94]. lncRNA-MBL2-4:3 is significantly up-regulated and lncRNA-AL355149.1-1 is significantly down-regulated in TSCC tumor tissues. The expression levels of these lncRNAs are restored by the injection of 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel in HN21B TSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner [93]. Thus, dysregulated lncRNAs are potential targets of HNC treatments\n",
      "lncRNAs are related to HNC radioresistance [95]. According to some analyses, the plasma levels of the lncRNA GAS5 in HNC patients respond to radical chemoradiotherapy. The pre- and post-radiotherapy GAS5 levels are significantly higher in HNC patients with a partial response to radiotherapy than in HNC patients exhibiting complete responses. Plasma GAS5 levels are a potential molecule biomarker for predicting radiotherapy responses in HNC patients [95]. MALAT1 expression is substantially increased in NPC tissues. Increased MALAT1 expression reduces NPC radiation sensitivity by improving the self-renewal of CSCs. MALAT1 knockdown in NPC sensitizes the tumor cells to ionizing radiation and reduces the percentage of ALDH1-postive cells displaying properties associated with CSCs [64]. Differences in lncRNAs expression have been observed between NPC cells treated with ionizing radiation and NPC cells treated without ionizing radiation. Curcumin alters lncRNA expression in NPC cells while increasing the susceptibility of NPC cells to ionizing radiation [96]. lncRNAs play a significant role in cancer radioresistance. lncRNA-based therapeutics might represent a new direction for cancer treatment, although numerous experiments must be performed\n",
      "CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "Whole-genome sequencing studies have revealed that protein-coding genes constitute only a small portion, approximately 1.5%, of the genome. Most genes in the genome are transcribed into noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), including lncRNAs, by RNA polymerase II [7]. An increasing number of reports indicate that lncRNAs significantly contribute to cancer biology, including HNC biology [15]. Dysregulated lncRNAs are significantly correlated with cancer development and progression in HNC [16]. The successful identification and characterization of lncRNAs may be a feasible strategy for studying lncRNAs in cancer. Microarray technology is one prospective method for screening irregular lncRNAs expression in malignant cancers. Knockdown or over-expression of certain lncRNAs in vitro and in vivo may reveal their functions and mechanisms in cancer biology. Some lncRNAs modulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels [61]. Some lncRNAs interact with DNA, RNA or proteins to exert their gene-regulating functions and affect the behavior of cancer cells. However, lncRNAs have multiple intricate functions and molecular mechanisms, and only a small fraction of lncRNAs and their functions in cancer biology have been discovered and investigated. In addition, the functions of the few known lncRNAs remain to be investigated in detail and additional functional lncRNAs remain to be identified\n",
      "Differential lncRNA expression between HNC tumors and normal tissues suggests that lncRNAs have potential for use as sensitive biomarkers in HNC detection and prognosis [16]. For example, high HOTAIR expression levels are related to HNC development, and lower levels of EMG3 are related to cancer metastasis [31, 51]. The correlations between lncRNA expression in patient saliva and the clinical stages of OSCC provide markers for a noninvasive and rapid diagnosis [90]. Over-expression of some tumor-promoting lncRNAs and reduced expression of some tumor-suppressing lncRNAs are related to poor OS and DFS. Cancer-related lncRNAs could be used as independent prognostic parameters in HNC [51, 91]. Although some reports have identified lncRNAs in body fluids [90, 91], the stability of peripheral lncRNAs remains largely unknown and lncRNA degradation may restrict the use of lncRNAs as biomarkers. Although some lncRNAs are negatively or positively correlated with the outcomes of HNC patients, the analysis of large samples is required to assess the utility of lncRNAs in clinical predictions\n",
      "As reported in numerous studies, dysregulation of lncRNAs plays a major role in HNC development, and lncRNAs are promising novel therapeutic targets for cancer intervention [4] because oncogenic lncRNAs are up-regulated and tumor-suppressing lncRNAs are down-regulated in HNC. Thus, the modulation of ectopic lncRNA expression is one direction for the development of lncRNA-based cancer therapies. For example, knockdown of HOTAIR or MALAT1 with siRNAs inhibits cancer-cell proliferation and increases apoptosis [28, 63]. Although success has been achieved in cell-based experiments in which lncRNAs served as therapeutic targets, lncRNA-targeted cancer therapies must overcome many obstacles before its implementation, and a tremendous amount of research is required to elucidate lncRNA structures, folding, functions, mechanisms and interactions with other molecules. The development of lncRNA-targeted therapies will require a detailed knowledge of the functions of lncRNAs in HNC\n",
      "In summary, dysregulated lncRNAs play an essential role in HNC tumorigenesis and progression. They may serve as oncogenes or tumor inhibitors, and further research is needed to determine their precise, detailed mechanisms and functions. The importance of lncRNAs in cancer suggests the possibility of developing lncRNA-oriented clinical applications. Although this problem presents some difficulties, there is also the strong possibility of significant advancements in the near future\n",

In a 1-year clinical trial, Qsymia phentermine 7.5 and topiramate 46 mg (recommended dose per label) [16], in conjunction with diet and exercise, generated a clinically significant weight loss of 6.6 % of body weight relative to diet and exercise plus placebo [17]. Statistically significant improvements with the Qsymia recommended dose compared with placebo were also noted in blood pressure, waist circumference, lipids, glycemic parameters, and inflammatory biomarkers. Moreover, rates of discontinuation with Qsymia were lower than with placebo, suggesting Qsymia has a tolerable side-effect profile. A follow-up study showed that weight loss was maintained after 2 years [18]\n",

Noting that a large percentage stopped taking their medication mid-trial (31 % in the Qsymia recommended dose compared to 43 % in placebo), costs were allocated to participants according to how long each remained on the medication during the first 52 weeks of the 56-week trial period.

      "To regulate gene expression, NFAT proteins interact with several proteins, such as transcriptional activators, co-activators and repressors [1]. Some of these interactions have been shown to be mediated by the TADs. Activator protein-1 (AP-1), the most well-characterized NFAT transcription partner, was first reported to interact with NFAT through its DBD [30]. However, functional interaction between AP-1 and NFAT1 has been shown to occur at the NFAT1 TAD-C [31]. NFAT1 also interacts with the IRF2BP2 transcriptional repressor through the TAD-C [28]. Moreover, the NFAT1 N-terminal TAD (TAD-N) interacts with other NFAT partners, such as p300, a well-known transcriptional co-activator [32]. Despite the low sequence similarity, the NFAT TADs are important structures that mediate the interaction between NFAT and partner proteins and are therefore very important for NFAT-mediated gene regulation. In this study, we observed that a NFAT1 TAD-C peptide (NFAT1 691-927) was unable to prevent CA-NFAT1-induced apoptosis by acting as dominant negative (Figure 4), suggesting that CA-NFAT1 may not interact with an NFAT partner protein through its TAD-C to induce apoptosis\n",

      "It has been previously shown that the TAD of EBNA2 is between residues 431 and 487 at the extreme C-terminus of the protein [36]. This region of EBNA2 contains a number of acidic amino acids (Asp and Glu) as well as several hydrophobic/aromatic residues [37]. The amino acid composition of the TAD from EBNA2 is similar to a number of human and viral TADs, including the human tumor suppressor protein p53 (p53) and the herpes simplex viral protein 16 (VP16). Not surprisingly, the TAD of EBNA2 targets similar factors as other acidic TADs from viral and mammalian proteins. including the general transcription factor IIB (TFIIB; [35]), the p62/Tfb1 (human/yeast) subunit of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH; [33]), the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 40 (TAF40; [35]) and the histone acetyltransfereases (HAT) CBP (CREB-binding protein)/p300 [38]. These interactions involve the acidic TAD since mutating Trp458 to Thr (W458T mutant) within the TAD of EBNA2 disrupts its binding to TFIIB, TFIIH, TAF40 and CBP/p300 resulting in reduced transactivation activity [33], [35], [38]\n",

Additionally, although the arch domain is not required for the protein–protein interactions with the TRAMP complex subunit Trf5, the absence of the arch can affect Trf5 interaction.

FN is initially secreted from Golgi-derived vesicles in a soluble non-adhesion-promoting form and then assembled into fibres through interaction with integrins on the cell surface35. These fibres may not be optimally positioned to promote migration in one direction and their assembly may not be dynamic enough to respond to fluctuating directional cues. By contrast, endocytosis and resecretion of FN–integrin complexes on exosomes likely facilitates dynamic placement of highly competent adhesive substrata that promote cellular motility. In a previous study, we found that resecretion of fluorescent FN at the bottom of cells occurred within 1 h of its addition to the culture medium and was rapidly incorporated into nascent streak-like adhesion structures9. Presumably this endocytosis–resecretion process is happening continuously so that at any given time there may be a pool of matrix-carrying exosomes in MVE that could be rapidly secreted and used for migration\n",

After these endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane, exosomes are secreted into the extracellular space. The ability of exosomes to carry and selectively deliver bioactive molecules (e.g., lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids) confers on them the capacity to modulate the activity of receptor cells, even if these cells are located in distant tissues or organs. Since exosomal cargo depends on cell type, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the biochemical composition of exosomes is fundamental to a comprehensive view of exosome function. Here, we review the latest advances concerning exosome function and biogenesis in T cells, with particular focus on the mechanism of protein sorting at multivesicular endosomes. Exosomes secreted by specific T-cell subsets can modulate the activity of immune cells, including other T-cell subsets. Ceramide, tetraspanins and MAL have been revealed to be important in exosome biogenesis by T cells. These molecules, therefore, constitute potential molecular targets for artificially modulating exosome production and, hence, the immune response for therapeutic purposes\n",

      "Chest Midline sternotomy, left posterolateral thoracotomy, or infraclavicular scars at the site of pacemaker/defibrillator generator implantation should not be overlooked and may provide the first clue regarding an underlying cardiovascular disorder in patients unable to provide a relevant history. A prominent venous collateral pattern may suggest subclavian or vena caval obstruction. If the head and neck appear dusky and slightly cyanotic and the venous pressure is grossly elevated without visible pulsations, a diagnosis of superior vena cava syndrome should be entertained. Thoracic cage abnormalities have been well described among patients with connective tissue disease syndromes. They include pectus carinatum (“pigeon chest”) and pectus excavatum (“funnel chest”). Obstructive lung disease is suggested by a barrel chest deformity, especially with tachypnea, pursed-lip breathing, and use of accessory muscles. The characteristically severe kyphosis and compensatory lumbar, pelvic, and knee flexion of ankylosing spondylitis should prompt careful auscultation for a murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR). Straight back syndrome refers to the loss of the normal kyphosis of the thoracic spine and has been described in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and its variants. In some patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease, the chest wall appears to be asymmetric, with anterior displacement of the left hemithorax. The respiratory rate and pattern should be noted during spontaneous breathing, with additional attention to depth, audible wheezing, and stridor. Lung examination can reveal adventitious sounds indicative of pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or pleuritis\n",

      "The physiologic picture of elevated filling pressures with atrial enlargement and preserved ventricular contractility with normal or reduced ventricular volumes can result from extensive fibrosis of the endocardium, without transmural myocardial disease. For patients who have not lived in the equatorial regions, this picture is rare, and when seen is often associated with a history of chronic hypereosinophilic syndrome (Löffler’s endocarditis), which is more common in men than women. In this disease, persistent hypereosinophilia of >1500 eos/mm3 for at least 6 months can cause an acute phase of eosinophilic injury in the endocardium (see earlier discussion of eosinophilic myocarditis), with systemic illness and injury to other organs. There is usually no obvious cause, but the hypereosinophilia can occasionally be explained by allergic, parasitic, or malignant disease. It is postulated to be followed by a period in which cardiac inflammation is replaced by evidence of fibrosis with superimposed thrombosis. In severe disease, the dense fibrotic layer can obliterate the ventricular apices and extend to thicken and tether the AV\n",
      "FIGURE 287-14 Amyloidosis—microscopic images of amyloid involving the myocar-valve leaflets. The clinical disease may present with dium. The left panel (hematoxylin and eosin stain) shows glassy, grey-pink amorphous heart failure, embolic events, and atrial arrhythmaterial infiltrating between cardiomyocytes, which stain a darker pink. The right panel mias. While plausible, the sequence of transition shows a sulfated blue stain that highlights the amyloid green and stains the cardiac from eosinophilic myocarditis or Löffler’s endocarmyocytes yellow. (The Congo red stain can also be used to highlight amyloid; under ditis to endomyocardial fibrosis has not been clearly polarized light, amyloid will have an apple-green birefringence when stained with Congo demonstrated. red.) Images at 100× original magnification. (Image courtesy of Robert Padera, MD, PhD, In tropical countries, up to one-quarter of heart Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston.) failure may be due to endomyocardial fibrosis, 1568 affecting either or both ventricles. This condition shares with the previous condition the partial obliteration of the ventricular apex with fibrosis extending into the valvular inflow tract and leaflets; however, it is not clear that the etiologies are the same for all cases. Pericardial effusions frequently accompany endomyocardial fibrosis but are not common in Löffler’s endocarditis. For endomyocardial fibrosis, there is no gender difference, but a higher prevalence in African-American populations. While tropical endomyocardial fibrosis could represent the end-stage of previous hypereosinophilic disease triggered by endemic parasites, neither prior parasitic infection nor hypereosinophilia is usually documented. Geographic nutritional deficiencies have also been proposed as an etiology. Medical treatment focuses on glucocorticoids and chemotherapy to suppress hypereosinophilia when present. Fluid retention may become increasingly resistant to diuretic therapy. Anticoagulation is recommended. Atrial fibrillation is associated with worse symptoms and prognosis, but may be difficult to suppress. Surgical resection of the apices and replacement of the fibrotic valves can improve symptoms, but surgical morbidity and mortality and later recurrence rates are high. The serotonin secreted by carcinoid tumors can produce fibrous plaques in the endocardium and right-sided cardiac valves, occasionally affecting left-sided valves, as well. Valvular lesions may be stenotic or regurgitant. Systemic symptoms include flushing and diarrhea. Liver disease from hepatic metastases may play a role by limiting hepatic function and thereby allowing more serotonin to reach the venous circulation\n",
